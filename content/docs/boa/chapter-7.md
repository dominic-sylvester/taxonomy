description: Hidden In Plain Sight
---

It was around 2008 when we recognized that our clients had a challenge hiring sales talent. They all wanted to hire sales talent. It's hard to hire one of your competitors because they've got an employment agreement, and it makes it difficult for them with their book of business encumbered. Or we can hire them, but they end up not being very good.

The next best thing for us was finding what we would call professional salespeople. These are people who knew that becoming a top-notch salesperson was their path, and they took it very seriously. They believe in training and likely already had a bunch of it. They know how to prospect and lay out a value proposition. They also know how to use other team members to help educate and close new business. In an interview, they knew what numbers to track, and they knew them cold without looking at a reference. Typically, we looked for someone that had five to ten years of sales experience with strong B2B prospecting. Sales is in their DNA. And so we decided we're going to step into this producer talent void and go help our clients recruit sales talent from other industries.

Our experiment was to pair them with a closer/mentor, and if they can tee up some appointments, the mentors can help close them, and they can learn in front of a prospect how to close business. Everybody wins.

The idea was to teach them the business with opportunities they create, but there was an issue. We knew that if this new producer was prospecting and we were going to help them figure out this business, we needed more data than the industry normally supplied. And that led us to think about lead indicators.

You've probably heard of the Lead versus Lag indicator. A Lag indicator is the last thing that shows up. Lead indicators are those behaviors or things we can do to create the Lag we're looking for.

Think about weight loss. If you want to lose weight, the Lag indicator is what the scale is telling you. But we know we can't lose weight by standing on a scale. We know that we've got to focus on calories in and calories burned, regardless of what weight loss program we choose.

Let's pretend to make this simple. We needed one appointment a week above, say, $10,000 in revenue. Don't get hung up on the numbers.

Just follow the logic. If somebody walked into their Monday morning sales tracking meeting, every Monday morning, they're sitting down talking about their previous week's prospecting. We're focusing on the Lead indicators. If you were coaching a young salesperson and they didn't get an appointment one week, and you asked them to get one appointment, the Lag, in this case, the one appointment, what questions would you ask? Nor-mally, I would ask them, "How many calls did you make?" "Hey, what kind of things were you hearing?" "What kind of objections?"

And so, we decided to track these lead indicators to help somebody establish benchmark data about what a new producer should expect.

Even during the interview process, somebody may ask us, well, how many appointments are you going to expect in a week? And how many calls is that going to take? We knew we needed this data, and nobody had it. And so we developed this producer activity sheet.

In the beginning, we had people we had recruited in a pool, but we also added about 90 other producers in the program that were within their first year because we knew we needed more data. And we will never forget what good news it was that if you look at this sheet, we have three metrics: attempts, conversations, and appointments. Our young producers only had to get five conversations to create one appointment. That metric has held steady to this day.

You think, Wow, this prospecting thing should be easy. If I need one appointment, just come in and make five calls. And anybody who has prospected for more than a day knows it's not that simple. This is one of the big takeaways, and it's the reason we name this chapter "Hidden In Plain Sight." This data for some reason, nobody talks about it. The five-to-one metric isn't broken. There's nothing wrong with that. Let's say you were trying to get five appointments a week, and you made five calls, and four people treated you terribly, but you got your appointment with one; that would be great. A five-to-one metric won't run anybody out of this business. But there's another, bigger problem.

If we move left so that the conversion rate of five conversations gets one appointment—that's a 20% conversion rate. There's nothing wrong with that. However, there is a severely broken metric, and that is the number of attempts it takes to get into one conversation. We rarely get a coaching request in our firm to help somebody improve the metric from attempt to conversation. The coaching requests we get are about overcoming objections.

Let's say we get somebody on the phone who is trying to improve the metric of conversation to attempt. There's nothing wrong with that.
And if we could create two appointments from five conversations, our book would be twice as big. But we can't manipulate people. We're only going to get the conversations we can get.

Let's look at why this metric is so bad—20 attempts to get into one conversation. Why is it so bad? We think the primary reason is voicemail.
We believe people don't take incoming calls, which is why getting people on the phone is so difficult.

An example: I had a young lady reach out to me last year, and she said, "Jeff, I need some help with my script." Now, she's asking about her script, and that's her language, not mine, but we don't script people. If she's asking about her script, she's worried about when she gets somebody on the phone, a conversation, creating an appointment. She's worried about that metric that's not that broken.

I said, "Great, we'll have that conversation. But do you have your data from last week?"

I love this. She immediately said to me, "I made 188 calls that yielded seven conversations that yielded one appointment."

It's so funny how close that tracks to our metrics of 20-to-one and five-to-one. And so I said, "Hey, I'm willing to have a conversation about your script, which is your seven-to-one conversion, but are you willing to have a conversation about the fact that you reached out to 188 people and you only talked to seven of them?"

She said, "Absolutely."

So we have our conversation. She reaches out a few weeks later and says, "Hey, I want you to know I made 22 attempts, got into seven conversations, and got four appointments." That was so rewarding for us to hear. And we would ask you this question. Have you ever tracked how many calls it takes you to get somebody on the phone? Because it's enlightening. We don't track things just to track them. We recommend tracking so you can predict a better future. This metric is hidden in plain sight, and it turns out it's like gold just lying on the ground. Get this fixed, and the results will change immediately.

One reason prospecting is so difficult is your prospect is hunkered in a bunker. And this bunker has a name. They are protected down in a war-like bunker; they're protected from salespeople. They don't want to talk to salespeople. Gatekeepers have been charged with keeping the gate.

Don't let anybody pass here. And so, to understand the name of the bunker, we would ask this question, what's the opposite of love?

And our instant reaction is hate. And it may be, but we think of love and hate as extreme emotions separated by a thin line. Think genius and insanity. They're extreme emotions. What we believe is that the opposite of love is indifference, not hate. This is why we call it The Bunker of Indifference.

If you were at your 20-year high school reunion and somebody said, "Do you remember Tom Johnson?" And this girl says, "Oh, yeah. I hate Tom Johnson. I never liked Tom."

Maybe that's the opposite of love, but really what we think is the opposite of love is someone saying, "I don't remember Tom." We believe that's a bigger slight. This bunker that your prospects live in, and they don't let any salespeople down there, it's a bunker of indifference. You don't exist to them. That bunker is built to protect you. The problem is we keep trying to go in the front door of that bunker. It's heavily fortified to keep salespeople out. But there's a little secret. That lady that went from 188 to seven conversations metric, she improved that to 22 attempts and seven conversations. She quit trying to go through the front door that's so heavily fortified. The back doors are wide open; the side windows are wide open.
And with a little bit of coaching, she was able to focus on that metric. This chapter is really about what we've always been told—if you want to improve something, you measure it. And yet most people don't measure attempts, conversations, and appointments.

And by the way, when I've been talking about making calls, I know that some of you are out working. You're out knocking on doors and seeing people. That is the same as an attempt on the phone to us. When you bring somebody in from another industry, and everybody depends upon them making it, and they've got to demonstrate that they can prospect, you have to have this data. We're suggesting you take a three-by-five index card and tri-fold it. It will create three segments, and on one segment, use tick marks for attempts, the middle segment use a tick mark for conversa-tions, and the right segment for appointments.

If we're going to get our Ph.D. in prospecting, we have to get better at simply getting people on the phone. It is the metric that is hidden in plain sight that makes the biggest difference. And as we get better at getting more people on the phone, then we actually get better at having the con-versation, and we will begin to convert those at a higher percentage as well.

Whether you're a new producer or a more seasoned producer that's lost some clarity about how to grow, we can predict a better future if we understand our metrics around attempts to conversations and conversations to appointments. It will become a competitive advantage for us within our firm and within our geographic space or our vertical industry. We will have a competitive advantage if we understand what that lead indicator is.

We are fortunate to have this unique vantage point where we get to see people that understand the power of this and see that they win at a higher rate than those that don't. It will actually reduce stress when we understand how many appointments we need each week, whether it's one appointment, two, or three, depending on the environment you're in, when we know that number, we have a much better chance of winning. It also reduces stress because we're inputting the appropriate amount of effort into our prospecting assembly line each day, each week, each month. And we get to fully leverage the compound effect of doing the right things every day to be able to grow our business in a very meaningful way.

Ultimately, the point of this chapter is to help people understand that there are simple metrics to create an easier, more effective way for you to predict a better future and get in front of a lot more opportunities with a lot less effort.
