title: Chapter Eight
description: Cold Calling Using A Creative Drop And How To Create A Referral Out Of Thin Air
---

Even though this is not a book about prospecting, we think it would be a huge mistake not to at least address the issue.

We think you have to have some of the key components working in your favor. So, in this chapter, we're going to try to give you some of our best prospecting tips and tools, things that perhaps you have not ever heard before, that our clients are using and making work for them on a daily basis. So, first, let me just start with a couple of high points.

If we're talking about prospecting methods that we teach and collaborate on, this could be a 25-chapter, 500-page book. In fact, we teach a yearlong course on prospecting called Prospecting Ph.D., and there is a lot to it.

We do think it's important to understand how to avoid the call reluctance that comes with prospecting.

So, when we think about the three variables that impact prospecting, your mindset, your skillset, and your cadence, think of these as an algebraic equation. If you could have a score of 10 in each of these three variables, the highest score you could have would be 1,000.
If you had a 10 in mindset attendance skillset and a 10 in cadence, you'd be the perfect prospector.

Unfortunately, very few of us have all three of those things mastered. The way we prospect has a lot to do with how successful we're going to be. If all you did every day was try to prospect with a cross-sell or call your existing clients, to try to sell them another line of business, then prospecting would be very easy. Prospecting would be easier if you had a CPA or a lawyer constantly introducing you and the ideal prospects. So how will you prospect?

Another issue would be if you're working in one industry or vertical with strong networking partners, you may even have a leads group.

So, the point is all prospecting is not the same. There are so many different ways to prospect.
Think of a cross-sell as a six-inch putt and a cold call to somebody that doesn't know you as an 18-foot putt. We want to try to do everything we can to make sure we're doing these shorter putts.

If we're effective at it, and we're confident, and the plot's not so difficult, we're probably going to do more of it, and it's easier to get in front of somebody with a center of influence or cross-sell.

Not only is it easier to get in front of them, it's also easier and faster to write the business. You just have more credibility when they meet
you.

We mentioned in an earlier chapter the biggest problem with prospecting, whether you've been doing this one month or ten years, is getting someone to engage in a conversation with you, whether that's dialing the phone and not being able to get anybody to answer on the other end, or stopping by people's office and trying to get them to engage in conversations.

Remember, the most important metric that we want you to take out of this book is it takes 20 phone calls to get into one conversation, but it only takes five conversations to get into one appointment.

As we're on the journey to help our clients get a Ph.D. in prospecting, we spend a lot of time trying to help people work on that first metricâ€” attempts to conversations. Instead of reaching out to 20 people to get one person on the phone, what if we could reach out to 20 people and get ten people on the phone? This is literally career-changing or life-changing.
How do you get more people to engage in dialog? We talk about two words that come to mind: curiosity and reciprocity.

Think about this:

Say I was prospecting an executive at a large company that doesn't know me, and I knew they went to the University of Texas in Austin and they don't take calls from salespeople, but I decide that I'm going to send them a life-size ice carving of the University of Texas Longhorn mascot Bevo, which is a 2,000-pound steer. So I send this full-size ice carving to their lobby, in the reception area. I call the gatekeeper, and I ask for Mr. Big.
I say, "This is Jeff Jenkins. May I speak to Mr. Big?"

They'll probably ask me, "What's this regarding?"

I will simply say, "Hey, I know Mr. Big went to the University of Texas. I sent over an ice carving of Bevo today, and I was just calling to make sure that he got it." I pause for a moment, and I say to the gatekeeper, "You know what? Can you just give me Mr. Big's voicemail?" I get his voicemail, and I say, "Hello, Mr. Big. I had an ice carving of Bevo sent over to your office today. I know that you're a University of Texas graduate, and I'm calling to make sure you got it and ask you to give me a call back when you have a second so I can explain why I sent that."

If I were to ask you this question, as the reader, would you call me back? If you got a life-size ice carving of your mascot, a tiger, a kangaroo, an elephant, or whatever your mascot, and someone literally sent that to your office and called and left you that voicemail, would you call them back?

We ask 20 people in our workshops, "Would you call me back?" And I think the smallest number we've ever gotten to that question is 13. Remember, the typical metric is if you called 20 people and left them a voicemail, one of those would call you back.

Here, the numbers we see are 20 ice carvings. At a minimum, 13 people out of 20 say they would call us back. You're probably not going to really send an ice carving, but we may be able to think of something like that.

Now, why did Mr. Big call me back when I left the voicemail? The answer to this question, you probably know, is curiosity. Curiosity is the greatest way to get people to call you back. If you call someone and leave a voicemail, they only call you back because they want to or they have to.

Everybody's busy. Everybody's overworked. We have a lot to work through. Their family, their spouse, their children, the board, maybe their church, employees, friends, family, etc. We've got to cut through all of that and make somebody want to call us back. The fastest way to do that is with curiosity because we're curious beings.

Now, we've learned that when we use someone's alma mater, like their university, it also drives some level of reciprocity. We went to some trouble. We know something about them. We're about to lay out some of our favorite cold call methodologies, which we call our ice carvings. If you want to get somebody on the phone, you've just got to figure out what you could send them to make them curious. What would create curiosity somewhat like that life-size ice carving of a beaver or a longhorn?

At our company, if we can't get in front of somebody with an introduction or referral, we quickly move to an ice carving. Now, we also call these creative drops. We have some of our favorite creative drops, but it's just so easy to go into Amazon and look up the University of Alabama or Notre Dame and find a bunch of unique gifts that are under $10 that we can send somebody to create some curiosity and reciprocity.

One of our favorite stories is about a producer who was more than 60 years old with a $1.5 million book of business. He wasn't that motivated to prospect, but he thought, This is easy. I will at least try it. So, he went on to his favorite prospecting resource MiEdge and found ten companies that would generate $100,000 in revenue if he were to win those accounts. Then he went to LinkedIn Sales Navigator and figured out who the CFO was of these ten companies. He was also able to find out what college they attended. This was in August, which made it the perfect time for him to appeal to the football fan in each of the CFOs. He then sent each a hooded sweatshirt with their alma mater printed on it. Some of these were sent from Amazon. Some were sent from their college bookstore. These colleges were Pac-12 schools such as USC, UCLA, Washington, Oregon, etc. So when the prospect received the hooded sweatshirt, they didn't know who it had come from.

That's the curiosity piece.

The fact that it was their alma mater, which many people love. That's the reciprocity piece.
So when he called the gatekeeper, he just asked for Mr. Big, the CFO. Many of them took his call. He left a voicemail for others and said, "Hey, I'm the guy that sent you the USC hooded sweatshirt. I was just calling to make sure you got it, and that you knew why I sent it." He would then leave his cell phone number.

We were amazed that he talked to all ten of these CFOs. In addition, he booked four on the first call with them, and others were willing to speak later. All of this happened from idea to booked appointments in two weeks.

He probably spent about $1,000. But again, he has a large book of business and is very confident in his abilities. The revenue represented by the ten CFOs' accounts would be $1 million.

So, you can see, the thousand dollars could pay a radical return on investment. Had he put his business card in there with the hooded sweatshirt, then he still would have had the reciprocity piece-somebody did something nice for them. But he would have lost the curiosity piece.

We've learned through trial and error: If you put your business card in with a creative drop which is what we also refer to as the ice carving, it ruins the curiosity piece. And we can estimate at least 50% better results, probably more. We believe the moment they know you're a broker, they're probably not going to call you back.

The gatekeeper often asks you what this is regarding, and it's really easy and simple. When they say, "What's this regarding?" We would say to the gatekeeper. "Please just reference the USC sweatshirt. He'll know," or "Please just reference the Oregon sweatshirt."

It's a very easy way to get a gatekeeper to put you through. These are magic words when you're talking to gatekeepers.

"He'll know" or "She'll know."

One of the reasons we had to develop this methodology is that our clients were being greatly hindered by voicemail and gatekeepers.

Twenty or thirty years ago, you could learn to build a relationship with Mr. or Mrs. Big's executive assistant, and they would actually help you and advocate for you to get 15 or 20 minutes.

With Mr. or Mrs. Big, we don't have that anymore, so it's difficult to come up with anything that works with voicemail.

You should challenge us on this. Find 10 or 15, or 20 creative drops. Send them to your target CFO or business owner, no card, no nothing, just curiosity and reciprocity.

The more you can find something that ties to them, the more you're going to have reciprocity working for you.

The creative drop solves a couple of problems. This is really a cold-call strategy. One of the reasons we like it is that call reluctance can be formed by making a lot of calls and nobody calling you back. This will help us solve that problem. Another reason we have call reluctance is we get a prospect on the phone. And we can hear the disappointment in their voice when they realize they got stuck on the phone with a salesperson. The creative drop can really help with this.

Early in the call, if we can just talk about the creative drop a little bit to build rapport before we reveal that we're a salesperson, the better reaction we may get from the prospect. It's a built-in pattern interrupt which we will discuss in the next chapter.

The longer you can build a little bit of rapport around the creative drop, the better it's going to be. When you do reveal that you're a sales-person, if they've relaxed a little bit, the calls go a lot better.

Beyond getting a few callbacks, we have call reluctance because we don't feel like we have a reason to call. A creative drop solves that problem. If I sent you a hooded sweatshirt or a Yeti cup, the reason for my call very simply is just to make sure you got it. While I've got you on the phone, I will also tell you why I sent it. That's really the reason for the call to see if you received it.

In the following chapter, we're going to talk about what we say when you get somebody on the phone which we call the "Three Asks." It dovetails very nicely with the creative drop. I sent the hooded sweatshirt to the USC graduate and said to the CFO, "If you don't mind, call me back. I want to make sure you got the sweatshirt and make sure you know why I sent it."

When they call me back, I tell them, "I wanted to make sure you received it. I wanted to make sure you know why I sent it because I work with CFOs of nonprofits (or whatever niche they are in), and I know you are one." So, we send a creative drop because of "who" they are. This will make more sense when we get to the Three Asks in the next chapter. The first ask for a meeting will be because of who they are, not because of what we do.

The Three Asks will make you confident about what you're going to say when you get people on the phone, but the creative drop can help get a lot of attention out of the call when you reveal too early in the typical sales call that you're a salesperson.

Look, you don't have to spend $100 on a creative drop, like the CFO that had the $1.5 million book of business. Reciprocity really just begins with someone seeing that you've gone to some trouble, and again, I'm more apt to call you back if there's some reason I want to reciprocate. But curiosity is probably worth twice as much as reciprocity. You may see on Facebook that they like fly fishing. You may see that they've run a half marathon. You may see there's a charity they believe in. All of these things we can find on social media and make for great creative drops.

The reason we call this a creative drop, the more creative it is, the better. It's something they've probably never received from anyone, much less from a salesperson.

Another great case study in creative drops is about a broker we worked with that didn't like the idea of creative drops, but she was part of a larger sales team that was routinely in a competition to see who could create the most appointments and she was not getting very far on her own.

She thought the creative drops were gimmicky, and we understood that the problem was the people in her office that were using them were getting far more appointments than she was. So we asked her this question: "Is there a creative drop that, if you received it, you wouldn't think was gimmicky? That you wouldn't think was cheesy?"

And she realized if somebody sent her a bottle of wine, she would not think that way and would probably return their call because of the gift.

So she found a vineyard that would etch people's names into the wine bottle. This is not fine wine from Napa or France, but good wine produced regionally. We were all amazed to learn that for every two bottles of wine she sent out, she got one appointment; she sent out 80 bottles of wine and yielded roughly 40 new business appointments.

This was somebody that hated the idea until she found one that made sense to her. And once she did, she was able to use this strategy to significantly ramp up prospecting and her new business production.

We have creative drops that are as cheap as a dollar that can be put in the U.S. mail. We have other clients, sales managers, that tell producers, "Hey, I'm gonna give you $3,000 for creative jobs. And every time you write a new business account, we're going to take a tiny percentage of the new business to pay for them." We have people consistently writing $400,000 a year in revenue that historically is only $100,000 or $150,000 because they were very good at what they did, but they just couldn't get enough people engaged.

The creative drop helped them blow up some call reluctance because it gave them a reason to call. It helped relax the person on the other end of the phone line but most importantly, it literally changed their career because they didn't have to call 20 people to get one person on the phone.

Hopefully, by now, you're starting to understand that creative drops can solve a lot of problems around cold calling.

There are some rules to creative drops that I think you have to understand. When talking to the gatekeeper, reference the creative drop. If you asked for Mr. Big and the gatekeeper asked you what this was regarding, you reference the Patagonia sweatshirt and say, "She'll know."

We want to be able to say, "She'll know" or "He'll know."

People always ask us, should we put our agency logo on the creative drop? The answer's no. We're not trying to use traditional marketing with this method. We are just trying to get a lot more people to call us back. We're trying to get people to call you back at a rate much better than the 20-to-one rate. People call us back because they're curious. Why did someone send me this?

So this is our best cold calling methodology. It will literally change your life if you figure this out for yourself. It solves many problems we face as prospectors.

There is one more prospecting method we would like to share with you. Again, we need to write another book on prospecting, but that's not what this book is about. We wanted to give you two of our unique methods to create many more new business appointments that we find easier to execute and, frankly, are a little more fun.

The second prospecting method is what we call "Running the R.O.O.T.A.," an acronym for Referral Qut Of Thin Air.

We made a decision a long time ago. We're not going to prospect 30 hours a week. We don't have time. We want to grow, and we want to leverage our time. We will get a few clients, serve them differently than they had been served before, and then ask them to introduce us to people they knew. That's how we built our business, and it worked.

Somewhere along the way, we started teaching people to do the same thing. You get some clients, and you'll over-serve those clients. You build a robust service calendar, you are consistent, you are unique and different, Blue Ocean, and they'll introduce you to people.

One reason so many people are not getting introduced is they're just average, and they're just like everybody else. But somewhere along the way, we ran into a problem. Look, we have a lot of really amazing clients. They are very good at what they do. We would consider them Blue Ocean Advisors. And here's what we learned.

Many times some of our best clients were not asking for referrals. And, you know why? Because they felt like it was putting undue pressure on the person they were asking, and since it put pressure on their client, then it put pressure on them, and so they just didn't ask.

That's problem number one.

Problem number two is when we look to ask people for introductions, there's a limited universe of people we know that can actually introduce us: People who understand what we do and have experienced what we do. They're fabulous for an introduction model, and the same goes for CPAs, bankers, or lawyers.

This universe can just be a little bit small.

So, our big question was how can we come up with a way to get 80% of the result of an introduction from our client without putting pressure on them? So again, maybe not quite as good as our client introducing us to a prospect, but what if it's only 80% as effective? And we can do it 100 more times?

That's what the R.O.O.T.A. is about. You don't have to ask anybody for anything. You don't have to ask for their permission. We believe if you want to learn how to run the R.O.O.T.A. most efficiently and effectively, then you'll want to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to simplify the process.

There are many tutorials out there, but a salesperson not leveraging Sales Navigator to see how you're connected to ideal prospects would be like a carpenter not having a hammer. It allows you to build a list of second-degree connections and is even more powerful if that can be done within your vertical. In case you didn't know, a second-degree connection would just be someone connected to one of your first-degree connections (some-one you're connected with) that you aren't connected with.

Let us give you the simplest example of how to run the R.O.O.T.A. and explain why it's so effective.

There are two parts to the R.O.O.T.A.: The front half is purely doing research. And there's the back half, where we call and try to execute the referral. Back during Covid, when all our neighbors happened to be out in their front yards at night with their favorite libation, everyone was out walking and doing things of that nature. I stopped at the curb and asked my neighbor across the street, "Hey, Jay, how are Ashley and the girls," he let me know they were doing fine.

The prospect that I want to get in front of is Michael Bosworth in Tyler, Texas. Jay also lives in Tyler. I simply asked Jay, "Do you know Michael Bosworth?"

He said, "Yeah, I do."

I then asked, "Jay, what do you think about him?" And that's it.

That simple, I now have laid the groundwork to execute my referral out of thin air by doing nothing more than asking my neighbor what he thinks about my target prospect, Michael Bosworth.

So now, I can go back home on a Friday night, call Michael, and leave him a voicemail.
"Hey, Michael, this is Ad Visor, I don't know if you know me, but I live across the street from Jay and Ashley Ferguson. Your name came up tonight in a brief conversation, and anyway, I wanted to share it with you. Give me a call back on my cell when you have a moment."

Running the R.O.O.T.A. could literally be that easy and commonly is. The front half is asking somebody about your target prospect, in this case, Jay, about Michael. Now, why did I do that? Because I needed to create a story so I could call Michael and tell him, "Hey, Michael, your name came up." Now, if I wanted to, I could make that research piece much more robust when I call Michael.

Back to the lawn conversation with Jay.

I could ask Jay if he knows anything about what I do for a living.

I work with insurance brokers.

I do a lot of research on the prospects before I ever call them.

I'm researching a prospect right now named Michael Bosworth. I like to get as many opinions on them as I can. I am very picky about who I work with, and I don't call on everyone.

Now, I'm doing that because Michael may end up asking Jay Ferguson, my neighbor. Hey, what did Jeff talk about? Or when I leave Michael a voicemail, he may call Jay.

And if you want to get more in-depth on this research piece, although I think you don't have to, think about what your prospect may ask this person and try to have a conversation.

What I want him to tell Michael is that he does a lot of research on prospects and he was checking you out.

Now, I actually like the easier version. In the first version, I just asked him if he knew Michael. I asked him his opinion, and he told me he was a good guy. And then I just called and left that on the voicemail.

When we ask people in our workshops how many would call someone back if they left that voicemail, everyone agrees it's much better than one out of 20, and most agree more than half at least.

Now, it's also fun if the gatekeeper answers and asks me what this call is regarding. I say I live across the street from Jay Ferguson, and Jay was telling me about Michael a couple of days ago, and I'm just following up on that conversation.

Creative drops and running the R.O.O.T.A. solve a huge problem with the gatekeeper.
Remember earlier we talked about whatever creative drop you send when the gatekeeper asks, you say, "Just reference the Yeti Cup with the University of Texas logo on it. He'll know"?

Well, with the R.O.O.T.A., we say, "I'm following up on a conversation I had with my next-door neighbor, Jay Ferguson, about Michael."

If they give me a hard time, I just hang up, call back after hours, and leave them a voicemail. This gets much, much better when you leave more specifics on your voicemail. We can build a much more robust voicemail for us to leave if we build a backstory. We can cite who we were speaking to, where we were, when we were there, and what the occasion was to make this voicemail much more familiar and authentic. So, now when we call Michael Bosworth, we can say, "Michael, I was at Jay Ferguson's lake house out on Lake Tyler a couple of weeks ago. We were celebrating his wife Susan's 40th birthday. At some point in the night, your name came up. If you don't mind, give me a call. I want to share the conversation with you briefly."

So, the more you will tell people where you were, what time it was, what day it was, and what the event was, the more real you are.

Let us give you one more example of someone running the R.O.O.T.A. on Jeff and being good at it.

He called Jeff the day after Thanksgiving several years ago and said, "Hey, Jeff, your name just keeps coming up," He named the three people Jeff's name had come up with and said they were kind of in the same industry.

He said, "Hey, if you're ever in Fort Worth, I'd love to buy you lunch at the Fort Worth Club."

Well, that was a great idea to say that because the Fort Worth Club is a cool place, it's where the Davey O'Brien Award is given out. As a matter of fact, the day I met this young man for lunch, I heard Vern Lundquist, the famous announcer, in the background. It was the day Baker Mayfield was getting that award for the nation's best quarterback in February several years ago.

There's something important we want you to understand. Never in a million years would Jeff think to ask him who brought his name up. This person could have asked three people about Jeff, so he could call and say, "Jeff, your name just keeps coming up."

Why wouldn't we ever ask him who brought our name up?

It's because you're so flattered. In a million years, it would never occur to you that this person may have brought your name up to three people so that they could call you and say your name just keeps coming up.

Now, if somebody were to ask us if we did that, and someone were to ask us who brought their name up, we would tell them we did, but it just never comes up. It's an easy pivot.

Running the R.O.O.T.A. solves a couple of other problems worth mentioning before we close out the chapter.

Asking somebody to introduce you to someone else creates pressure. You don't need a CPA or a client to run the R.O.O.T.A. because we're just trying to get a callback. You can run the R.O.O.T.A. with anybody.

We could ask somebody that trims our yard, that babysits our kids, whose kids play ball with our kids, or anyone if they know our target prospect. It's about getting a callback.
All we have to do is bring their name up in a conversation so that we can call the prospect and let them know their name came up.

I can't tell you how many appointments we've had booked over the years between our clients and us, but it is staggering. It's honestly not a fair fight.

A record for appointments generated in one week from running the R.O.O.T.A. came from someone in our 2021 prospecting Ph.D. class who booked 17 appointments in one week because he got excited and learned how to execute the R.O.O.T.A. He ran the R.O.O.T.A. with three COls, and it worked beautifully.

Another benefit of running the R.O.O.T.A. is that you get to control the timeframe. Someone may tell you they're going to make an introduction for you, but they never get around to it. But with this, you don't have to wait.

Once you ask Jay Ferguson about his neighbor Michael Bosworth, and he tells his opinion, it's "go time." You can call Michael at any point after that.

The final advantage of the R.O.O.T.A. is that you get to control what the buyer hears about you. We will not lead with what we do (broker), which is the ultimate non-starter. He may introduce us in a number of ways that we don't want to be introduced. The R.O.O.T.A. puts that power back in your hands.

And so we would encourage you to take us up on this and learn how to run the R.O.O.T.A. Whether it's creative drops or making cold calls that are running the R.O.O.T.A., this is the fastest way we know at Blueprint to get more opportunities into your pipeline.

Now, in the next chapter, we're going to talk about what you're going to say if somebody actually picks up the phone. Think about the compound effect of running the R.O.O.T.A. once a day, once a week, or once a month for the rest of your career. If you can do this 20 times, you may have as many as 15 people calling you back.

One of the reasons senior producers don't make cold calls is they don't have enough time to make 20 calls for one person to call them back. The R.O.O.T.A. will dramatically increase that, making these calls a lot warmer. You're borrowing the credibility; you're the person you're doing the research. And these calls just go much, much easier from the job.

One of our favorite things also about the R.O.O.T.A. is it's very social in nature. It should feel like a business play.

If you're in sales, you're probably fairly gracious socially. People who are good socially are good at running the R.O.O.T.A. If they're going out to a party, they want to make sure they meet a lot of people. Maybe they go on to LinkedIn and get connected with the people they met at the party and then see who those people know.

We can navigate our social lives, our kids' functions, really everywhere we live and work. You could be at little four-year-old Timmy's birthday party, and somebody's "name comes up." As you can see, it's not a fair fight.

When it comes to using your cadence to fill your pipeline, we would ask you to do this twice a week, once on Tuesday morning at nine and once on Thursday morning at nine. If you really want to step it up, invest one hour a week in running the R.O.O.T.A. and watch how your book of business blows up.
