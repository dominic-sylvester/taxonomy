description: Building A Proposal That Creates Value-The Blueprint
---

In this chapter, we will discuss how to create a proposal for a prospect that will get you hired. The name of our company is Blueprint Consulting Group. In our world, we call a proposal a "blueprint" for obvious reasons. You can call it whatever you want, but the purpose of this chapter is to try to explain the important components of a good proposal.

First and foremost, a good proposal should always create value. When we talk about creating value, who are we talking about creating value for? We are talking about creating value for our prospect. We're always thinking about them first. How can we impact what they're doing? How can we create value for them? Remember, in the discovery phase of the process, we took their program apart, and we wanted to see all the different components of how they were operating and how they are currently doing things. Our goal in doing that is to see if we can improve upon them.

When it comes to creating value within a proposal, we have to have a meaningful backdrop for the solutions we recommend. It is what makes our process different from a capability's presentation.

Creating a value-based proposal was why we went through the discovery phase, cast vision, and identified roadblocks by digging into their processes to find flaws. If we didn't go through all the trouble of understanding their situation to find out what they really wanted to see happen, we would have to guess what mattered, and we all know, from first-hand experience, how ineffective guessing is. In fact, if you have the "guessing what matters" skill, you should have thrown this book in the trash a long time ago.

Again, in discovery, we're taking their program apart. A good proposal should put their program back together based on your wisdom and expertise. And the better the discovery meeting you do, the better proposal you can have.

We win business in the discovery meetings. Our proposals should simply confirm the beliefs they have about us already because we're the ones that took the time to care enough to take a deep dive into their situation and help improve it with no strings attached. So how do we create value? Again, it begins with having by being relevant to their situation.

Based on what we understand, we're trying to make their program authentically more effective for them. It's why RFPs don't work as well as the process that we've outlined in this book. The RFP is all about the broker, and it's not anything about the prospect. An RFP is what someone "could" do, but the blueprint process is what we "would" do, and there is a huge difference between the two. This process takes the broker out of the middle and puts the client in the middle.

We get to clarify a prospect's most important goals. We get to understand the roadblocks that can keep that from happening, and then we can build a plan to help them go forth and conquer, and an RFP just cannot do that.

Sometimes your prospect might have to do an RFP as a regular part of their process. Municipalities, schools, and nonprofits are notorious for that type of thing. When this happens, we like to present our process as a companion process to the RFP process, and it tells the other half of the story. The RFP is about the broker, and our process is about the prospect and everything they need to do differently to get better outcomes. Most of our clients are so ineffective at RFP's they use our process as a litmus test for how serious a prospect is about getting it right. If they are serious, they will do a side-by-side, and we feel like we can stack the deck in our favor, but if they won't take us up on our process, they are likely hiding the fact they need a third or fourth participant in the RFP process, and we politely walk away from those. If you are good at them, then by all means, keep doing them, but our clients moved on from them because they are ineffective at helping the prospect get better outcomes and frankly are the "red ocean."

Let's discuss some simple ways to create relevance in your proposal. Number one, and if you go back to chapter two, where we talk about The Change Formula: an important variable to getting people to change is a powerful vision for the future. It's why this really important question: If we were looking at two years from now or three years from now. And you were excited about the outcomes that your program was getting. What would be happening then that's not happening now?

We want to document that vision because we're going to make our tools and resources much more relevant if we do a thorough job of that. We can list that in a proposal as an "opportunity" or desired "outcome" or pick your synonym. Use whatever words you want.

A second simple way to create a powerful backdrop relevant to your prospect is to document the areas where they're most dissatisfied (another variable in The Change Formula).

We document their vision, and we also document where they are frustrated. That could be listed in a proposal as a threat, challenge, hazard, red flag, etc.

Thirdly, a backdrop that can make a difference is documenting what they are good at or what element of their program they want to keep. Similar to other categories, such as an "opportunity" or a "threat," we can list it as a "strength" or something similar.

With any proposal that we give, we should be able to document a few "strengths." It will prove that your proposal is not some type of hot-button presentation but a strategic plan that is meaningful in many ways. Think of it as a framework similar to the traditional S.W.O.T. (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis that many business advisors/consultants use. But it also will allow us to enhance something that's really meaningful to them already.

Again, if I'm going to give a proposal to somebody, I would never deliver it without understanding what elements of their program they want to make sure that they want to keep. It could be an insurance carrier, a piece of technology, or an account manager. Who knows what they might tell us, but we need to know before we build the proposal, not after delivering it.

The proposal is built to "seize the opportunities" and "eliminate these threats" to your program, and these are the strengths that we're going to enhance.

After we list all the opportunities, threats, and strengths, we want to park right there and get their buy-in on that list before we get into solutions. That is going to let you know whether you're going to win this deal. It's valuable salesperson intel that you'll get by stopping right there and making sure they give you feedback. Make everyone reply to the question: "Did we get this right? Is the rest of this document built to make these things come to pass?"

We don't move to the toolboxes until they tell us, "Yes, you nailed it." We do not move on with rolling out their plan and the tools to implement that plan until they give us their buy-in.

We can layer in more questions if we like: Is there anything you would move up or down in priority on this list? Is there anything you would take off this list or add to it? And then, you need to be quiet and let them answer when you ask this series of questions. If they don't answer you, you need to ask that question again. That is our first "close." It's actually a hard closeâ€”it doesn't feel like a hard close to the buyer, but it is.

Their answer will give you valuable intel as to whether you got it right based on what they told you in the discovery meeting. Once they tell you, "Yes, you got this right," often they will say, "I'm not sure why." It's just a common colloquialism. When you really get it right, they say, "You nailed it." It's fun for us when that happens, and it happens often.

One of the first-ever blueprint proposals we did roughly 17 years ago was with one of our favorite clients and a longtime friend out of Michigan. We went through this part of the proposal, and the company's CEO was focused on every word. The CEO's name was Jean. We got along well; in fact, we called her "Jean the dancing machine." She was really bright, and this was a nonprofit.

This was a roughly $125,000 revenue deal, and after walking through the threats, opportunities, and strengths, we simply asked, "Did we get this right? Would you change anything?" And then there was a long pause, and it was a little awkward, but we didn't say a word. (We had made sure before the meeting and shared with the team we were with that when we ask this first closing question, we have to let them answer.)

After a few minutes, she looked up at us over her glasses. They had started sliding down her nose a bit, and she said, "You nailed it." And we knew at that moment that this deal was ours. Or better yet, we knew we could only screw it up from there. It was one of the original blueprints we had done, and so we were still pioneering it, but we knew if we could document how we could help solve the problems that we identified and the key objectives that they wanted to accomplish, we could get hired. We are fortunate that we consistently win business, with high closing ratios, when they tell us, "You nailed it."

Let's look at an outline of the entire process now that we have set the stage for the Blueprint proposal, and we will explain the purpose of each step after that.

| Item          | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Threat 1      |             |
| Threat 2      |             |
| Threat 3      |             |
| Threat 4      |             |
| Threat 5      |             |
| Opportunity 1 |             |
| Opportunity 2 |             |
| Opportunity 3 |             |
| Opportunity 4 |             |
| Opportunity 5 |             |
| Strength 1    |             |
| Strength 2    |             |
| Strength 3    |             |

Every "threat" has a corresponding "opportunity." We never leave a threat unattended. Even if it's something we don't do on a regular basis, it could be something like "We need better training for our managers."

If they say it, we document it.

In the blueprint, we might simply provide, as our solution, an opportunity for us to help them create an RFP for some manager training. We don't need every solution in-house to be valuable to them. 99% of the time, we will have a tool or capability in our toolbox because discovery will lead us there, but sometimes when we ask the vision question, we learn about initiatives that are important to them. This is a good sign that they see you as an advisor instead of a salesperson.

You don't need more than five or six threats or opportunities, and the strengths can be just two or three.

The threats and opportunities should go in the same order, and then as you start presenting the solutions by toolbox, they go in the same order as well.

Here is an example everyone can understand:

Threat - your program has limited cost containment measures being leveraged, causing you to overpay for your insurance.

Opportunity - leverage and alternative funding strategy to create more pricing transparency to lower costs by lowering risk factors.

### Toolbox 1 - Cost Containment Toolbox

This could be many things, ranging from self-insured plans to captives and a host of other ways to lower costs, that you all have at your disposal.

After we go through the Threats, Opportunities, and Strengths, we then present our solutions by toolbox, tying them back to the threats, opportunities, and strengths. We then move to a simple action plan that ties it all together, and it should make it really simple to move forward.
Sometimes, if we aren't careful, we can give them too much to think about to make a decision quickly. Because of that, we want to create a simple action plan that shows it's easy to step into this new plan we have created for them. Just 8-10 items in order are fine.

The worst thing that can happen is, "Wow, you've really given us a lot to think about," and if we aren't extra careful, it will happen.

After the action plan, we simply ask, "How soon do you think you should begin implementing some of these solutions to move toward these better outcomes?" It's better if they don't sense we are trying to close them or get them to hire us at this moment. We want the truth, and at this phase, we can get a clear understanding of their urgency with this question, especially if they don't perceive this as a "close." Even though we are closing with this question, we are using softer language to flush out their true intentions.
After the simple action plan, we then move to how they can hire us if they choose to do so. We assume they aren't hiring us on the spot, and we want to use that to our advantage.

We prefer to provide a couple of options at this stage of the close. The first option is for them to make us their broker, and everyone has hired us by making us their broker. However, if you can't do that, then we will do it for a fee of X dollars.

There is some serious psychology behind closing by giving them a few options. Not the least of which is this method diffuses the tension of them firing the incumbent broker. In essence, we are giving them the option to keep them by presenting an option that has a fee closely associated with the commissions. This exposes how little their current broker is doing for what they are being paid, especially compared to what you will do with the proposal you just outlined. Remember, differentiation happens by comparison, and the difference between what you're proposing and what they are getting can be stark.

As a final close, we love to ask, "What would keep us from partnering on this?" We love to ask it more because we are curious instead of because we are trying to get hired. It's actually a hard close, using really soft language that keeps us neutral about the outcome of the deal in their mind, but we get the valuable intel we need to see if any roadblocks could keep this from happening.

We collaborate with our clients heavily because agencies don't compete with each other in our program, and we have created some amazing proposals over the years. If you are on a team that works closely or in some type of non-competing collaboration, we recommend working together to build a database of great proposals to pull from and learn from.
