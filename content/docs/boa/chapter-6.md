title: Chapter Six
description: The Prospecting Effectiveness Formula
---

This may be the most important chapter in this book because it doesn't matter how great your process is if you can't get in front of new opportun-ities. Jeb Blount, in his book Fanatical Prospecting, says that if you are a producer today and make $300,000 a year, it's because you are willing to put your compensation at risk based on your ability to prospect. If someone else was doing the prospecting for you, Jeb says you would probably be making closer to $100,000 per year, and we have found that to be true.

What does he mean by that? He means only a very small percentage of people are willing to prospect for a living or actually have the skillset to do that. We worked with a young guy in Texas once who was not very successful as a producer, and he was really smart and driven, and it always drove us crazy that we couldn't help him. He went to work for a top-ten broker, and he called us about six months after starting. He said, "I want you to know I've done about $150,000 in revenue already. It was important to me that you know that. I wanted to let you know that I'm not a loser." We knew he wasn't a loser; he was one of the few people we laid awake in bed at night, wondering what was not clicking.

Why couldn't we help that guy? Because he really seemed to have everything. We asked him what had changed, and he said, "The truth is, I'm an oil and gas guy, and I can now tee up these opportunities at my new firm. In addition to that, there's a guy that works with me in a support role that used to be a risk manager for an oil and gas company. And he said he closes them all when I take him out on these calls. I think I can do a million dollars in revenue next year in new business revenue."

Now, here's a producer that wasn't successful, and now he's telling us he thinks he can write $1 million in new revenue in a year, which for a lot of people is a career goal as a total book of business.

The risk manager probably makes a good living, but he could be making so much more if he were willing and able to prospect. Your job wouldn't be worth nearly the money you can make without your willingness to prospect.

Prospecting probably is love/hate for a lot of us, but it should be mostly love. If you make a good living in this business, it's because you're willing and able to prospect. We are no different. In fact, any salesperson is in the same situation. It's why we always talk about how we're all pursuing a Ph.D. in prospecting, and you should be, too. We teach a course called Prospecting Ph.D., which you can find at www.prospectingphd.com.

Why Ph.D.? Well, think about this. In your undergraduate courses, you mostly read a book, and then you regurgitate what you've learned by taking a test. Well, a Ph.D. is very different. You're reading all the material, but you're out in the real world. You're out working with companies to execute business, marketing, or technology plans. And so, a Prospecting Ph.D. would encompass the book knowledge, which we need to read books like The Obstacle Is The Way, Extreme Ownership, Discipline Equals Freedom, Financial Prospecting, Purple Cow, The Compound Effect, Networking Is A Contact Sport, etc. as well as doing the prospecting on a regular basis. So our hope from this chapter is that you will forever be in pursuit of your Prospecting Ph.D. It's how and why you will create wealth in this business if you are able to do it.

We have determined a formula for you to create wealth and be highly effective at prospecting. We call it the Prospecting Effectiveness Formula, and it reads like this:

Mindset x Skillset x Cadence = Prospecting Effectiveness.

Take a few minutes and score yourself on a scale of 1-10 in each category and see how you do. If you score a 10 in each category, your score will be 1,000.

### Mindset

First, let's discuss some of the attributes on a growing list that a salesperson with a strong prospecting mindset possesses:

- They have a 10-year vision and a 3-year vision for the growth of their books (the fuel of the flame of desire), and those visions help determine their annual goals. A person with a tough prospecting mindset will have goals that are always bigger than what a sales leader or mentor would have for them.
- Every call is an opportunity to learn and feed our growth mindset.
- They don't think prospects owe them anything.
- They don't accept people not calling them back, they get creative, and most people call them back.
- They aren't looking for prospects that are unhappy with their current broker. They are looking for clients that want to perform better.
- They read books that make them better and feed their toughness mindset (at least ten pages a day).
- They likely have a vertical or expertise they have developed.
- They hang in there longer on a sales call than others.
- They know where call reluctance comes from, and they learn to overcome it.
- They check their intent always. They typically want to help people perform better and don't lead with their tools and their "stuff."
- They know who their ideal prospect is and have a list of them.

We've always studied prospecting, but it became exponentially more important in March 2020 when the COVID-19 shutdown happened.

Our clients froze. We think it's because they are great people with good values. But questions arose, like is it even ethical to prospect during a pandemic? People were freaked, and some of them were losing loved ones and co-workers, and no one really understood the situation. And then the lockdowns came.

Ultimately, we arrived at the answer; if you're calling with help, then hell yes, it's ok. In fact, we need to be helping people every chance we get. It's how we should prospect, anyway. It's a mindset, for sure. Consistently the people we meet that are the most successful have a mindset to help people.

We have a client whose prospects are in the aviation industry, and they were not eligible for PPP loans. They were covered under the Cares Act. And somebody in the government administration had commented that they weren't eligible for these forgivable loans, and he figured out they were. Well, he unlocked $20 million worth of forgivable loans for some of his prospects and clients. If that's what you're doing, it's okay to call somebody in a pandemic.

Do you remember the devastation of Hurricane Katrina on the streets of New Orleans? We wanted to be like those amazing people in Louisiana and other states that were taking the flat-bottom boats out of the rafters of their garages and floating down into flooded areas, passing out water and life vests, etc. We didn't want to be one of those people standing at the water's edge with generators they were selling at three times the retail cost.

If our intent is good when we are prospecting, if we have good news for people in bad situations, and if we bring value to people, then we should be prospecting, and it will work. The helping people mindset works even in good times and helps eliminate people's call reluctance.

We had a young sales candidate take a call reluctance test, The SPQ Gold. It helps us understand where our call reluctance comes from. The good thing about call reluctance is we're not born with it, we develop it, so if it's learned, it can be unlearned. If you're like us, you would think call reluctance would come from fear of rejection. As we mentioned before, surprisingly, his came from having no vision/goals for his future. If a salesperson is missing that part of the mindset, they just aren't going to fight through the knockdowns this job can have each day. These things power us through prospecting a bunch of people telling you, "I don't want to talk to you." "I hate you." "Quit calling me." "I love my current provider." There-fore, the mindset becomes foundational to success.

All three variables of the prospecting effectiveness formula are important and interrelated, but it all begins with mindset. Your mindset can improve as your skillset improves and your cadence kicks in, but if you do the mindset work on the front end, you can expedite the timeframe on growth.

### Skillset

Our most common coaching requests are skillset related. You can't imagine how many times we are asked, "Will you give me a script so I can improve my odds of booking a meeting when I am speaking with a prospect for the first time?" It's important that you are on solid ground in that regard. However, we will make a case in the next chapter that the script problem, as important as it is, isn't the biggest problem salespeople face. Think about how much your mindset will improve your skillset and how much better any skillset gets with more repetitions (cadence).

Skillset, at its core, is the ability to build a list of prospects that you really want to work with, and get into a conversation with them, and then, when you do speak with them, be able to convert them from a conversation into an initial meeting. In his book Book Yourself Solid, Michael Port speaks about the importance of standing on solid ground when you get into a conversation with a prospect. You need to know what you're going to say. The ultimate indicator of a highly effective skillset is that you're confident that when you get a prospect engaged in a conversation, you can convert them to a meeting at a very high percentage. To repeat: Highly effective prospectors know how to build a list of ideal prospects they want to sign as clients, they know how to get them on the phone (or in person if canvassing), and they know how to convert those conversations into appointments at a very high percentage.

We will be giving some very effective tips to do all of this later on in the book. We won't be discussing all of them because this book would be 500 pages, but we will look at some unique methods we use every day that will work for you. If you know prospecting is a big issue for you and you value learning about different ways to do it, you would probably really benefit from our year-long prospecting class that you can investigate by visiting [www.prospectingphd.com](http://www.prospectingphd.com/)

Let's talk about list building for a moment. When we look at list building, so many people start building lists through the lens of a cold call. When we build a list, we start with the accounts in your agency that can be cross-sold. I want to talk about the cross-sell for a second, which we call "cross-serve." Getting in front of an existing customer is a lot easier than getting in front of somebody that doesn't know you. That's obviously common sense. When we meet a banker or a CPA, we build a relationship with them through what we think of as wine and dine. Well, we need to wine and dine the producers inside our own firm.

If you're a P&C broker, wine and dine the EB broker or the surety broker. If you're the EB broker, wine and dine the P&C. If you lived in Dallas, you would take a CPA or a lawyer to a Mavericks game; we'll take the EB broker to a Mavericks game. We want you to think about this as you build your prospect list. The first component of a good skillset is to think of what the easiest way is to get in front of our prospects. What will be the easiest, quickest way to get in front of them but also to make them a client? We will eventually work our way out to the most difficult method, which is cold calling. The point we are making is depending on how we approach a prospect has an impact on the likelihood of us writing them and how quickly.

Our favorite ways to build lists for cold calling in this industry would be MiEdge, Zoominfo, and Sales Navigator. Those are the three tools you need in your tool belt if you're building a cold call list, but you start with other customers in your firm. Make those your customers. A lot of people in your firm need to be wining and dining the other side of the house. Take that to a new level, make that a skillset of yours, and blow up the cross-serve while everybody else makes a bunch of cold calls.

The second thing is to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to build a second-degree list to make list building easier and more accurate. We're going to talk about that in a later chapter, what we refer to as a referral out of thin air. Use your clients and people that you know from your personal life to get in front of people you don't know. We're trying to convince you to quit rushing to build lists from cold calls.

Now, the next part of the formula is getting people on the phone and then getting them to meet with you. We're going to talk about that in later chapters, but right now, I want to talk about the third formula, which is cadence.

### Cadence

In most books you read, there are a couple of stats, and they're different in different books, but you'll read things like this: 47% of all salespeople only reach out to a prospect once. And yet it takes seven calls to a prospect for them to remember who you are and what you do for a living. That's where cadence comes in.

Here's the most important thing about cadence: If you wanted to sell your home today, what are the odds you would reach out to a realtor you don't currently know? When we ask that question, most people say it's zero or close to zero. We all know realtors and would probably reach out to someone we know. Well, let's ask this question, if you became unhappy with your incumbent broker, what's the probability you would reach out to a broker you don't know? We think the answers are very similar to the selling your home question. Brokers are calling on people they're interacting with every day at their country clubs, leveraging COl's and working in nonprofits etc. Jeb Blount says prospecting is nothing more than building familiarity with a prospect so that when a buying window opens, they think of you.
Here's the other interesting thing about cadence. We've got some data that we believe if you were able to get ten people on the phone today, only two of those would probably meet with you.

Eight of those probably would not. No matter what you say or how great your value proposition is, it has nothing to do with you. It's where they are in life. It's what mood they're in. It's how busy they are. It's a lot of factors you don't control. And so here's what's interesting. Think of one group of people that are sitting in this home. Eight out of ten are sitting in this home that won't meet with you for any reason. Two out of ten are sitting in this home and will meet with you the day you call. Here's what's fascinating. Those people are switching those homes all the time, therefore having a repeated, consistent way to stay in touch with target prospects, people that you know you would like to add to your book of business. Cadence is the way we stay in touch with them. One of these days, we will all be on cadence. One of these days, we will be using technology to automate our voicemail and email cadence to make all this so much easier. But right now, cadence is the ability to stay in touch with your target customer so that when a buying window opens, they think of you.

To make this easier, the compound effect creates all these latent opportunities today, but they will show up a little later. The way anything works is by building a relationship with someone so that at the right time, they're willing to talk with you. And so, really, what is cadence? It's making calls every week. The best cadence formula we've seen looks like this. Making calls on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, whether that's 30 minutes or 3 hours. And then go back to building the list, loving on your list. Every Friday morning, every book we read, whether it's Atomic Habits or Deep Work or The Compound Effect, will tell you this discipline will let you down. What you can depend on are habits. Why not just make the commitment today? The way you're going to build a skillset is through cadence. You are going to create an assembly line for prospecting.

What's an assembly line? An assembly line has these processes and inputs, and that assembly line runs 8 hours a day, 16 hours a day, 24 hours a day. We're asking you, Do you want to solve every problem you have? Think about this. What would there be to dislike about any sales job if your pipeline was always overflowing? Well, cadence is the key to establishing the assembly line. We help people establish assembly lines for prospecting. They're running when your pipeline is empty. They're running when your pipeline is full, instead of it running in fits and starts when you're in the mood to prospect, the most effective prospectors make it a lifestyle. They prospect in good times and in bad. They're never worried about their pipeline. They're never worried if their largest customer fires them. That happens primarily due to a change of control. What industry hasn't been impacted by being rolled up by private equity firms or the CFO moves? A new CFO comes, and he's got a relationship with a large broker.
If we can get the cadence right, and by the way, how do you build a skillset through cadence? Through making calls? We build a skillset.

What happens as my skillset gets better? My mindset gets better. Well, what happens when my mindset gets better? I use cadence, and I make more calls because I'm feeling more confident. These are all interrelated.

Now that you understand the prospecting effectiveness formula, score yourself. Those of you serious about getting your Ph.D. in prospecting at the end of each month, put it on your calendar for the first Monday of each month to give yourself a score. How you did with prospecting effectiveness, paying particular attention to cadence. Because I'll tell you, if your cadence is there, it's a little bit like this. My wife comes home from work. We've been married for 32 years, and my mood determines how I treat her when she walks through the door. Well, let's flip that. Let's say I'm going to treat her how she should be treated and how a great husband would treat her, and that is going to actually impact or direct my mood. What's my point? Make the calls and let the calls determine your mood. Don't start with, What mood am I in? And should I make the calls?

Here's what we know: Salespeople, if they know who they are going to call next week and they know what they're going to say to them next week, they're more likely to work the cadence each week. That's where tools like SalesLoft come in and make this really easy because we can take the guesswork about the work that we need to do next week.

In our cadence, we tend to our list on Friday afternoons for the next week, and then Tuesdays and Thursdays, we make our cadence calls. Again, cadence is about the repetition of staying in front of certain prospects that just aren't going to respond to you no matter what you do until a buying window opens. We've seen cadence transform salespeoples careers in just over 90 days by putting 40 new prospects into their cadence per week. And in 90 to 120 days, they have to back away from putting 40 new prospects in their cadence because their pipelines are overflowing. cadence is often the missing piece.

We read a statistic recently, and We've read these types of statistics many times over the years, that 48% of salespeople try to get a prospect on the phone one time, and it takes multiple times to be able to do that. That's where our cadence comes in. It doesn't have to be this huge, monumental reach out. We just need to stay in touch with people so that they think of us when a buying window opens.
