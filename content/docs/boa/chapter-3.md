title: Chapter Three
description: The Initial Meeting - What Happens When We First Meet With A Prospect?
---

We started Blueprint in February 2005 based on one simple premise: What if we could have a place to take a prospect that was any place other than a quote/bid? What if we gave them an alternative to a quote/bid as the first step that they would take with us? Whether that was some type of review or analysis or whatever that may be. It was a chance to understand some things about them, and it was not a quote/bid. It was them talking to us, not us talking to them. If we could pull that off, we could end up weeding out those prospects that had no intention of hiring us.

It's interesting how prospects may think they're actually doing us a favor by letting us quote/bid their insurance. We realized early on, while riding with producers on sales calls, that these prospects thought they were doing us a favor by letting us quote/bid even though they didn't intend to hire us. It's as if we, as brokers, were going to get some kind of credits from insurance companies, like airline miles or something. We soon realized that if we didn't have a way to figure out a prospect's intentions, we could end up doing a lot of work and never have a real chance at winning a deal.

Our company, Blueprint, was built on that premise first and foremost. Again, what if we had an alternative to the quoting process as a first step to take a prospect toward, and it gave us a lot of intel about what their real intentions were?

That first step with a prospect, we believe, should be more valuable than a quote/bid. We're not saying that we're never going to quote/bid; we're just saying we're not going to start there. In essence, the quote/bid is going to be the last financial lever that we will help them pull. So, that was the premise that Blueprint was built on, and it's really evolved from there. We have also realized over the years that closing ratios are as much impacted by who we end up having in the room with us as it is by the process we take people through or our conversations.

Salespeople can have a really good process. They can be great salespeople who ask the right questions, define the next steps and ask for the business, but it will be less effective if they don't have the right people in the room. Our data shows it's actually much less effective. As we discuss how we handle the initial meeting, it's very difficult in an initial meeting to get the right people in the room. We often don't, which is going to make that second meeting even more important to us as we progress in this conversation and explain why the Blueprint process is built the way that it is. In fact, if you look at the next graphic, there's a simple baseball diamond (which illustrates the point we are making).

In its simplest form, the Blueprint process follows the same steps as a base path on a baseball field. First base represents an initial meeting. The initial meeting is intended to last around 20 to 30 minutes. They may go longer, but we are in the prospecting phase, so we ask for only 20 to 30 minutes for the initial appointment. It is intended to be a brief meeting to see if there's a fit, and we are hoping to get the prospect to agree to the next meeting (2nd base). Our goal would be to contrast our process to their process and how our process will deliver a different set of outcomes.

There is a bigger win for the prospect by going through our process instead of their process, which typically is some type of quote/bid or a request for proposal (RFP), where all of the focus is on us, the broker, instead of their company and their goals. We want to change that to bring the focus off of us, the broker, and onto the actual prospect. Let's focus on them, what they're trying to do, and the roadblocks that could impede pro-gress. We need them to go through our process, and the initial meeting is set up to make sure the likelihood of that happening is as high as possible.

As you can see, represented by second base in the graphic, in our world, second base represents what we call a discovery meeting. Feel free to call that by a different name, but it is a very important phase of any sales process. It is what takes the focus off of us and puts it onto them. It is where we find out how to make our tools and capabilities relevant to their situation (value creation). That is a chance for us to really understand what the prospect is trying to do and give us a sense of what we could be doing differently to serve them better based on many different variables. Whether it's an employee benefits program or a risk management/insurance that we're looking at, it's important that we have a thorough discovery phase. We already made that case earlier in chapter two when we were discussing the importance of an advisory process, that it always begins with discovery. Again, in the Blueprint process, second base is that discovery meeting. It lasts 60-90 minutes and can go longer when they start talking.

Just like in baseball, when we get all the right stakeholders into the discovery meeting (second base), that is a scoring position. Our closing ratios are basically the same from second base as they are from third base. Third base represents a proposal, and we call it a "Blueprint," but our clients have many different names for it.

Now let's get more tactical on the initial meeting. This chapter is about getting a prospect to abandon their process and go through ours instead. We will walk through this in three different phases of the initial meeting - the open, the middle, and the third part, transitioning to Discovery (second base).

We recommend reading both approaches for Employee Benefits and Property and Casualty (P&C), even though they are very different. A savvy salesperson will pick up good ideas from both sides.

## Employee Benefits:

### The Open

Before we even get to the meeting, there should be a mindset shift toward them and the idea that we aren't going to "sell" them anything. Before we went into an initial or discovery meeting, one of our favorite people in the world would always make us bow our heads and pray. She did not pray that we would win the deal (like we probably would), she simply prayed that these people we were about to meet with would be better off when we left them than before we got there. Let us tell you, when she was in a meeting, people would open up to her like no one we have ever seen. It's because she cares about them and their success, and it just jumps out at everyone. She would never consider just pitching and selling and they knew it. The immediate trust and rapport she built because of her undying commitment for them to win was next level. It might not surprise you; she has built a phenomenal firm and reputation with a massive book. A simple way to get into the right mindset is just to take the approach that you're going to help them. It works every time. You will get them talking with that approach faster than any other, and anyone can do it with a little commitment to giving a damn. In fact, you can use this book to prop open the door if you get this concept. This thought process will help you create a dynamic that lowers buyers' resistance instead of raising it. Again, this is something we think about all the time.

Our instincts are not always right; they don't always serve us well. A lot of the things we say and do that we think create trust actually don't create trust. They create the opposite effect. They make a buyer's resistance go up. We have to have it low. They won't talk to us if we don't get this right.

Because our job is to really lower buyer's resistance, it is absolutely imperative that we do things and say things in order for them to sense that we're not there trying to sell them anything. A practical way to open up the discussion is to let the prospect know, "We don't come to these meetings assuming that it makes sense for us to do business together. We're here to see if there's a fit and if there are any opportunities that we can work on together, and if so, let's keep talking." They don't know we mean "keep talking" in a formal discovery meeting, but that's ok. They will as we "transition to discovery.‚Äù

We are trying to create this neutral environment where they see us as somebody who's not going to say anything or do anything to win their business (pitfall number one). It's powerful if you get good at it and you see your prospect relax.

Beyond lowering buyers' resistance and creating trust to get them talking, we ensure we check in on what they want to get out of the meeting. You will be shocked at how many people have something on their minds they are willing to share if we will let them. We can find out the main thing we need to solve for them by asking that question, and it needs to be standard operating procedure. If you are a sales leader reading this book, like me, I would add it to your list of questions to ask a producer when they come back from an initial meeting. "When you asked them what they wanted to get out of the meeting, exactly how did they respond?"

Within the initial meeting, it is important that we don't solve problems when they bring them up. We want to begin probing around the issue they brought up and see how real it is, how long it has gone on, and if they have tried to solve it already. It will be a great reason for them to go to second base with us if we solve the problem. It is always better when we can show patience there. It will keep us in advisor status and set us up for a proposal that creates value. When we can stack things up against the status quo (and the incumbent), it's always better than a one-off solution too early.

Instead of solving problems too early, we recommend planting some seeds of doubt that they're being taken care of as well as they could be and like they should be, as opposed to presenting a solution or a tool or a resource that we don't know if they need yet. Let's wait until third base.
A key component to being a Blue Ocean Advisor is that we lead to our tools, not with our tools. We will get to solve their problems later, and in a big way, I promise.

Beyond planting seeds of doubt about their situation, it's also powerful to create curiosity about what's possible if they approach this the right way. Planting seeds of doubt and creating curiosity go hand-in-hand. We will discuss how to do that shortly.

## The Middle

Once we have created the right environment with buyers' resistance low, we want to start asking them some questions and see if they will answer them. Remember, the Holy Grail in Sales is getting real buyers to be open and honest with us about their current situation and what they would like to see happen.

The graphic below is a sample of how we can get a buyer talking. It is a simple left/right column comparison that we refer to as The Performance Spectrum (see Graphic 3.1). It's designed to compare and contrast how two different types of companies approach their employee healthcare. You can have some fun with this tool.

It's a great opportunity for us to check in with the buyer and ask them, "Hey, where would you put yourself on the spectrum?" And commonly, people will give themselves a middle-of-the-road score, and even more commonly, they will respond with, "Hey, some of these things we are really good at, and some we are not." But the point is, and we talked about this when we were talking about the components of differentiation, is that nothing is good or bad, better or worse, except by comparison. And this chart is a simple comparison for them to go, "Which side of this spectrum am I on?" If you are a sales leader, I would ask a producer, when coming back from an initial meeting, "When you walked them through the performance spectrum, how did each person rate their company's performance?" It will help drive important behaviors, especially for newer producers that don't have all of this figured out yet.

On the left side are those things that lesser-performing companies are dealing with compared to higher-performing companies. You can see on the left side, it's more reactive, it's not very transparent, and it's frustrating. The math doesn't make sense. Employees are not that enthusiastic about the benefits, which really impacts our return on investment. Because of that, HR is overly burdened and so it's just kind of a mess, or it can be a mess. Yet on the right side of the performance spectrum, it's very proactive. Our program is transparent. They understand why they're paying what they're paying. The financial levers they're pulling are crystal clear. They're not overpaying. And they have a way of comparing that to others, and they know it. Their employees are happy with the benefits that are being offered. HR is not overly burdened. They're actually working on corporate initiatives. Overall, they feel like for the money they're spending, it's really working for them.

<Image src="/images/CHAPTER-THREE/1.jpg" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />
<div align="center">Graphic 3.2</div>

We just want to see if they're going to be open and honest with us about their current situation. And then again, I'm not going to drill down into those. If they say, "We're not doing that well, we give ourselves a five or a four or a six on the spectrum scoring." Or if they say, "We do well at some of these, not so well at others," I'm not going to probe into which ones are which. I'm just making the case that there are different outcomes for these people that approach it a certain way. And by the way, that way, it's going to be the Blue Ocean Advisor way. We know going in that we have a way to help them perform better. And that's what the setup to this is. So, we will ask a buyer, "We mentioned here that the high-performing companies know why they're paying what they're paying. They understand the financial levers that make a difference, and they're pulling them. Let me just ask you, Mr. And Mrs. Buyer, walk me through the process you have that gives you confidence that you're getting the best financial deal possible. And what are you comparing that to?" Again, we know they don't have a good answer for this; we just want them to admit it.

We've already lowered the buyers' resistance. They trust us. You know they don't have a good answer to that question. Notice that we asked them to walk us through a process. It's hard for them to make up a process they don't have on the fly. So we want them to walk us through a process that we know they don't have.

And if they do have a good answer to those questions, our potential to find out quickly whether we're going to move forward with these people increases dramatically. If they're already doing extremely well on all of this, we find out in 30 minutes instead of 30 hours' worth of bid/ quoting whether we're going to move forward with these people. So, we love asking that question. It's one of our favorite questions to ask because it's a really quick check-in to find out if we have somebody who is willing to tell us the truth.

And again, what if they do have an amazing process for that? We might even learn something that we can use with every prospective client we encounter down the road. But typically, that question is going to get us where we need to go. That's going to be a soft spot in their armor that will allow us to set up the Blueprint process to get them to take that second meeting with us (scoring position) because, by the time we get to the end of the Blueprint process, they're going to have a better feel for all that they could do to get a better financial deal and know how to get the best deal.

And then also there are some good ROI questions that I like to ask in an initial meeting. So there are things that we can do to make sure they're getting the best financial deal. And then the other side of the coin is that there are things we can do to make sure they're multiplying the effectiveness of each employee benefit dollar they're spending.

Let us explain what we mean. As we look at high-performing programs, let's say we do find out that somebody is in the right financial structure. They're pulling all the financial levers that they can, and they're getting the best financial deal possible. But if their employees don't value it, it's not a high-performing program. It's not doing for them what they had hoped it would do. In fact, if you look at Graphic 3.2 (below), there has been all types of research over the years that clearly shows we can show a prospect this graphic and say, "Look, even above average plans, if there's not an effective communication and engagement strategy, only one in four people inside of the company will value it, sometimes spending millions of dollars a year.‚Äù

<Image src="/images/CHAPTER-THREE/2.jpg" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />
<div align="center">Graphic 3.3</div>

"Companies are spending millions of dollars a year, and only one out of four people will value the benefits that are being offered. Yet, when you look at even a below-average plan, if there is an effective communication and engagement strategy, then closer to 80% of the people value it." So this is a really powerful concept.

Again, all we're trying to do is get them to go to the next phase of our process, which is the discovery phase. They've already admitted they don't have a good financial process. Now I'm going to get them to admit they don't have a really good process to impact how employees feel about the benefits that are being offered. And even an HR person will admit that employees don't appreciate all that they're doing for them. Those are two simple examples that have worked for us over the years to get a buyer curious about what these processes look like, to really plant some seeds of doubt that they may have seen everything they could see. And it's a powerful motivator to get them to spend 60 to 90 minutes with us in the discovery session, which we're going to explain in more detail in the next chapter, which is just a really simple, structured conversation to understand what situation could be different.

## Transitioning to discovery

As we begin to try to close the initial meeting, get them to second base, the discovery meeting, we are going to say:

There are really four different outcomes that you're going to get by going through the process with us that would require you to spend about 60 to 90 minutes with us in the discovery session and then about another 60 minutes with us as we roll out what we would call a Blueprint. By spending this time with us, you will understand how your program compares to high-performing programs and what you could be doing differently to perform better.

Second, you're going to understand what financial levers you could be pulling that you're not aware of, and you're going to have a better sense of a financial process and a way to know that you're getting the best financial deal possible.

Thirdly, you're going to have a way to take the dollars that you're spending and multiply their effectiveness through a series of toolboxes that you can see here that we're going to be drawing from to help you fill up your toolbox to run this more effectively and get a better return.

And lastly, you're going to understand your team will be aligned around what you could be doing differently in a plan that we call a blueprint. And the blueprint is yours to keep whether you hire us or not.

We have worked with a mega-producer who is an absolute monster at writing business and also mentoring people. We would all be lucky to have someone like him to mentor us, and you would understand why if you heard the way people speak about him. He refers to the concept we discussed as "What, Why & ROI." He believes, and so do we, that every producer needs to know these three things‚Äî especially the ROI for someone if they will go through the process. If you know what is in it for them, and that reason is a good reason for them, they will do almost anything you ask. In short, most people don't want to go through a process, but they will endure the process if they get something meaningful out of it. You need to know what that is.

Often, saying "whether you hire us or not" makes producers feel uncomfortable because it's counterintuitive (Opposite George). What we have found, though, is that the Holy Grail in sales is getting real buyers open and honest with us. The process that we're outlining does that for you as a producer. And what you will find is that 7 to 8 out of 10 people hire you once the real buyers get in the room. In the discovery phase, it is a 70%-80% closing ratio. We're weeding out those people who really aren't trying to get it right but want you to give them a quote/bid because they need one or fill out an RFP because they need one when the deck is already stacked against you. Let's weed those people out. Let's get the people really looking to perform better to go through this process. They're going to get those four outcomes. And again, if our intent is good, and we're saying that it should be, and we talked about that in chapter one and chapter two, why it's important that our intentions are good.

If your intentions are good, people will take us up on this. And even if they're a little bit hesitant, we can say to them, "Hey, you're going to get these four outcomes whether you hire us or not. I'm curious, why won't you take me up on this?" We can gently press them a bit, and you can also probably tell that the Challenger Sale has greatly influenced what we believe and how we interface with the prospect. So our point is that if our intentions are good and we actually have a better way to help these people, then we can challenge their way of thinking differently than we can if we're just salespeople.

## Property and Casualty

We've laid out a baseball diamond. It's really cute when you go to a T-ball game and a five-year-old runs from first to third. Well, it's not cute in professional sales. And we see it all the time in the P&C world. We show up for the initial meeting, and we collect a stack of documents. We skip second base. That's the Holy Grail in sales, where we get those real buyers in a room and get them open and honest for their benefit to see what's possible with their insurance and risk management. So we skip second base, and like the little T-ball player, we go from first to third. And what do we do in between? We go to our markets. We collect all these documents on first base after the initial meeting. And then we take them to market.

Here's what's funny. They may have been with their broker for five or six years. You've spent a total of maybe two to three hours with them. No matter how good the quote/bid is that you have from your favorite carrier, it's not enough. They're not going to fire their broker. People make decisions emotionally and justify them logically. This is a huge emotional decision. It's not enough. And so think about this. This may have happened to you. You go out on the initial meeting. You gather documents. You submit those to the insurance carrier of choice. You get them back.

You take your favorite one. You develop a proposal, and you take it out to your prospect, and you know you've done a fabulous job. You're saving them. They're spending $200k right now. Your proposal is at $160k. They told you in the initial meeting they would move. They told you they're not married to their broker. And so you give them their proposal, and they tell you, this looks really good. Check back with me on Friday. And then, when you check back Friday, you can't get them on the phone. You talk to them early the next week, and they say, "Hey, we're sorry. This was really good, but at the end of the day, there just wasn't enough reason to move." And you're confused about what happened, or maybe you know what happened.

They called their broker (I honestly don't believe they called their broker trying to do something immoral to you). They called their broker because they like their broker, and their broker said something like this, "Mr. Client, if that proposal is real, you need to take it. But I've got my doubts. For somebody to save you that much money, I've got my doubts. Let me take a look." Lo and behold, they look. But in the meantime, they go back to their favorite incumbent carrier, and they get them to match your price at the end of the day because they own the relationship. They can sell that. You all know it's played out thousands of times.

We are convinced it's the reason why our industry has a 90% to 95% renewal retention. People are not calling the incumbent broker back, asking them to match the premium. They're calling them back because they feel guilty. They feel guilty they went out and got other quotes/bids. We don't know why that is; we just know that it is. And so what if you decided I'll never again go from first to third base? It could be the greatest thing you get out of reading this book. You don't even know what you'll talk about on second base yet. But you know I'm not going from first to third anymore.

We aren't going to go into this in depth, but a little bit of an idea. How can you get somebody that's really predisposed to want a quote/bid off that idea? They want you to go from first to third because that's what they've been taught. That's what we taught them. But we know that favors the incumbent, but more importantly, it hurts your prospect even more.

There's no way you can help somebody that you don't know. Really help them, anyway. We had an underwriter tell us once that they want to know if the producer that sent them the submission knows the owner of a company. They want to know that the company's owner actually cares about safety. And we're like, you may not know that, but you can't skip meeting the owner of the company. We've got to meet the person.

We've got to be able to tell their story. So let's talk about what a good initial meeting looks like on a commercial account. And it starts with this idea. You are not there to convince anybody of anything or manipulate anybody. Because here's the deal.

When you present them with new information that they didn't know about, how do they react to it? And you're going to work with those that react favorably. And I think that takes a lot of pressure off you. This will change your life in sales.

You're looking for ideal prospects. In the initial meeting, they will raise their hand and say to you, "I'm ideal." We learned this from Michael Port in his book, Book Yourself Solid. He does a beautiful job of explaining this. We're not going to ask the question in this way, but we're only going to go to second base or discovery. We're only going to move forward with people that will take us up on this one thing. This one thing we're not going to ask people, "Can you fire your broker?" That's too much too soon.

They don't know us, as we've already said. They're probably going to be forced to lie to us if they want us to give them a second bid just to keep their favorite incumbent broker honest. So instead of asking, "Can you fire your broker?" In our initial meeting, we're asking this simple ques-tion: "Will you let us show you our best work?" That's it. Very simple.

The sales process we've developed is designed in the initial meeting to show people what's flawed with the current system and how we built our best work to fix the flaws. If you look at Graphic 3.3, we call this "market mayhem." We start out with initial meetings, something like this.
"We've really been looking forward to this meeting." Notice I didn't say thank you for taking the time to meet with us.

Our youngest brother Brian played football at LSU, and he talks about protecting your half of the field. Brian says if you've ever seen a fight take place before a college football game with a bunch of 19-year-olds pumped up with testosterone, maybe it's Alabama vs. Auburn, Michigan vs. Ohio State, or Texas vs. Oklahoma. These guys have hated each other forever. That's in their DNA. And he says, when you see those fights, what happened was somebody was coming over to the other person's half of the field during warmups.

And he says sales is no different, that we give up too much of our field. Buyers want to respect us. They want us to be advisors, not peddlers.
But we go in, and we pin ourselves back on our own 40-yard line by saying things like, "Wow, thanks for agreeing to meet with us." We rode with a producer once who opened the meeting with, "We are honored that you would meet with us."

Now think about the position that automatically puts you in, subordinating you. They're going to do everything they can to subordinate you. You don't need to help them. So let's change our language to - "I've really been looking forward to this meeting. I've heard nice things about you." And as we look to lower sales resistance and make them not hate that they're in this meeting, we'd say, "Hey, look, we haven't forgotten we asked you for 20 minutes. We're not going to be here any longer than that unless you are asking a lot of questions. We've only got 30 minutes anyway. By the way, we're not going to ask to quote/bid your insurance; I mentioned that on the phone. We recognize you've got relationships. We're long-term players. We're playing a long game here but have a simple agenda. We want to walk you through what we mentioned on the phone. But before we do that, is there anything you want to ensure we cover? Because we want to make sure it's a good use of your time."

We are so focused on the idea that they know this is all about them, for their sake. We're not talking about us, how big we are, how great we are, how many employees we have, or how many tools we have. We're asking them, "Have you got anything you want to discuss? We'll throw our agenda away. We called you, so we came with the agenda. That's why you took the meeting. But we can throw it in the trash. What do you want to talk about?" We ask that question for two reasons. A, to show them it's about them, but B, to see if they have some pain that they want to tell us about. We won't ask, "Do you have any problems with your current broker?" That's usually a throwaway question.

"I'm not married to them," they might say.

They have to tell you what you want to hear for them to get what they want (the 3rd bid). That's not our model. We feel like that's a little more peddler language, but we can say, "Hey, if there's anything you want to talk about, we do want to make sure that we cover that today." If they say no, then we're going to go to Graphic 3.3, which we call "market mayhem."

<div align="center">Graphic 3.4 - Market Mayhem</div>

And here you're going to challenge the status quo. If the quote/bid process yields 90% wind of the incumbent, as evidenced by 90% renewal retention year over year in our industry, why would you play that game, especially if it's bad for them? So you're going to show them how that game works. We've got three brokers going to four different carriers. You can see that markets are being blocked.

When we talk about challenging the status quo, it doesn't have to be done in an obnoxious way.

We want to share an interesting story. A couple of years ago, we had a young man that went out to see a lady at the initial meeting. And here are the rules that she gave him:

"We're an 8/14 renewal. All quotes/bids have to be in by August 1 (By the way, this was in early June). We do not assign markets. If you and a broker get into an argument over a market, we won't do a broker of record to give it back. There's no broker of records. Those are the rules."

Now, I think as a young salesperson, my response would have been, "Okey doke." As an older salesperson, I probably would have told her where to go, and it wouldn't be polite. But listen how he challenged the status quo. She was in the middle of "market mayhem," and he very politely said, "Hey, that's one way to go about it, and I think I know why you're doing it. May I show you a different way?" He laid out our initial meeting. Just like I've discussed, he invited her to a discovery meeting. When we heard about the story, it was two to three days after the discovery meeting when this lady made him and my client her broker through a broker of record letter. Think about it. She had set up the worst possible process. But you know what?
She actually turned out to be an ideal prospect. When we showed her a better way in a different way, we didn't manipulate her because we couldn't.
We didn't convince her of anything. We laid out logically and empirically why it's better to look at this thing through the risk manager route, not the broker route. She actually agreed with us. Nobody had ever laid that out in a way that made sense. So I hope that really brings everything together inside of the initial meeting. You remember how this young producer approached that, and we try to replicate it when we can.

When market mayhem is in play, carriers are declining the risk because it's got different information. One carrier declines the risk because they know it's over-shopped. You tell the prospect what you think is wrong with this, but you're on such good footing. Based on The Challenger Sale:
Taking Control of the Customer Conversation, the preeminent book after the crash of 2008, you're on solid ground when you're challenging an old, antiquated, tired buying model.

So here you talk about what you think. Some people think you're letting the market pick the broker. People say, "Hey, you're literally letting the incumbent broker block all the markets when they get that request for loss runs in an attempt to create competition. You're creating a monopoly."

Whatever you believe, plug it in here. You'd say to people, "That's not our approach." The way we really believe you challenge the status quo is to let people know that it's a broker-driven model. We've transitioned our model to, what is it that a risk manager is doing to get a better ROI to lower cost? As you can see in Graphic 3.4, the risk manager understands an underwriter is going to look at how much risk they see, and they're going to attach a resulting premium or a corresponding premium to that.

In Graphic 3.4, you can see if you want to cut the premium, you must cut the risk. So a broker takes you to market to get a better deal‚Äî the last 60 to 90 days of the year. A risk manager works all year to shrink risk so they can shrink premiums. An underwriter develops a premium by deciding what losses they will see on this account over the next 12 months. They're going to take those losses. They're going to figure it out. If they're going to spend $80,000 on losses next year, then they will add in what they need for expenses and what they need for profit. And that's what they're going to charge in our industry.

Buyers are still so focused on this market mayhem, the belief they can save money on insurance through doing more marketing. That's like saying somebody with a low credit score of 580 and is also unemployed can get a better interest rate by simply hiring more mortgage brokers. Clearly that will not work. Instead, they need to shrink the risk to the mortgage broker or to the mortgage company.

In the mortgage world, how do they shrink the risk? By getting credit scores up and by getting incomes up. So how do we shrink risk? Because we're going to ask people to spend some time with us in discovery so that we can better assess their situation. Spend some time with us, and let us compare your program to the best programs in your industry that have full-time risk managers. They have a huge advantage over you.
We're not going to suggest you hire a full-time risk manager. We're going to look for the three or four things that you might be doing, low-hanging fruit that we could take from the risk management model, and what you could be doing if you just knew about them. The problem is we can't guess which ones are going to work the best for you. We don't know you, but we've developed a process, and we're going to show you that in Graphic 3.5.
The next step is discovery. And if you look at discovery, that's where we spend about an hour with you, with all your leadership team, everybody that has a stake in this risk.

I want to speak about risk for just a minute more. When you start a business or a nonprofit, you have risk. You have risk with your employ-ees. You have risk with your customers. You have risk with a whole body of people.

If you're out driving in a truck, you have risk with the general public. And so there's a cost to risk. For every dollar at the top of a profit and loss statement, someone worked hard to create that dollar. And risk is where those dollars get siphoned off out of your P&L. If we can shrink the risk, then we can shrink the cost of that risk. If you have a driver on a truck that breaks his or her ankle unloading that truck, your workers' compensation cost may go up. But more importantly, you now don't have a driver on that truck. And there may be a bigger cost to that risk getting those things delivered because we don't have a deep bench of other employees that can hop on that truck. Our model is a game changer. And you producers that are reading this right now, you've got a decision to make. You're going down one path or the other in this business, and you need to make the decision and stake everything on it. Push all your chips on the table one way or the other. You're a bidder. You're going to bid insurance, or you're going to go down this path of understanding, What investments has my firm already made to shrink risk?

What investments will we be making in the future? As we learn how to shrink risk, we can literally stake out the only clients we want when we're in the initial meeting-we're not interested in the bidders. How freeing would that feel? We're interested in those that want to shrink risk: less risk, less money going toward paying for risk, whether that's through the injured employee not being injured or through lower insurance costs. In Graphic 3.5, we're showing them the toolboxes we have to shrink risk. And the three most important toolboxes that shrink risk are loss modeling, risk mitigation, and noninsurance transfer. Your firms have already made investments into those toolboxes, and prospects don't like vague promises of how you're going to help them. They want to know specifics so that we can define the toolbox. We can talk about investments our firm has made into those toolboxes because we understand this is what risk managers do all day, all year. They shrink risk. You might say, "So, would you be interested in spending an hour with us in this process we've described in Graphic 3.6 from discovery? You can see we will come back and deliver you a blueprint."

<div align="center">Graphic 3.7 - Blueprint Process</div>

We continue, "What is a blueprint? It's a form of proposal that identifies the low-hanging fruit to shrink risk and a plan to make it happen.
You don't have to hire us to get a blueprint. We don't charge for it. Maybe we should. Right now, we don't. I think one of these days, we probably will.
But as of today, Mr. Prospect, we don't charge for a blueprint. So let me tell you, if you want to go through the discovery process, what you're going to get from us, most importantly, we're going to start with just comparing your program with the very best. What that's probably going to yield? Is it going to show areas where you're vulnerable because you don't have a full-time risk manager? That's not your fault. We're trying to close that gap between you and the best. What's the low-hanging fruit that if you had a full-time risk manager, somebody could help you seize upon? And you're going to have a plan that your team can work together to get a greater return on investment on all this risk that your firm has to take on."

"So those are probably the three or four best things that you'll get Mr. Prospect out of going through discovery with us. But ultimately, that's up to you. Would you like to book that discovery meeting?"

We spend hours and hours teaching our clients how to execute this, and you will understand it more as we progress in this book, but for now, go back to the central themes. The incumbent wins 90% of the time on the quote/bid process. The client or prospect loses 90% of the time because of "market mayhem." And so why wouldn't it make sense for you to say, "You know what? I'll never, ever participate in that game again." We've already said we may end up quoting, but we're not going to start with a quote/bid. We're not going to go from first to third base. Mandatory, mandatory, nonnegotiable. We go from first to second base. Even if your best friend started a company and there's no competition, why wouldn't you take them to second base? Why wouldn't you say, "Hey, let me learn everything you've got."

An underwriter is going to be leery of a new company, but if we spend time in discovery, we can learn all the things they're already doing to mitigate risk. Maybe it's their background, maybe it's their bias, maybe it's the resumes of all the people, and they've actually been doing this same type of work for a long time. We've got to meet with them and understand how to tell their story through the lens of shrinking risk so that underwriters don't overcharge them. If you want anything and everything you can do to help a prospect, you've got to take them to discovery to learn. Also, don't forget ideal prospect. You don't want to work with everybody.

We know that a lot of these prospects just want a quote/bid. Risk advisors don't quote/bid. Insurance account managers do. Risk advisors help people mitigate and manage risk, and you can only do that through taking them to second base.

Once you familiarize yourself by taking people through a discovery phase, you will realize that your tools are more valuable when they are more relevant and your wisdom is appreciated. More people will hire you. The right type of people will hire you. A logical reason is that we're weeding out the people who only wanted a quote/bid or they need a third bid. They're not willing to spend a little extra time with us to get it right because they want you to go do a bunch of work for them that they need us to do for them so they can meet someone else's requirements for them to complete a bidding project. That's the good news. Closing ratios go up, clients see you as different and the quality of work you're doing, you're appreciated for, you enjoy more, and ultimately you get more referrals by taking them down this path.

We're trying to change how people view this and talk about it. And we want to become Blue Ocean, where we're actually talking about different things, we're saying different things, we're interfacing with a prospect in a different way, and we get to look unique because we are unique and that's really what we're trying to do within the blueprint process. In the initial meeting, we start off differently right out of the gate.
