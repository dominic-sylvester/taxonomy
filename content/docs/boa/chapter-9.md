title: Chapter Nine
description: Pattern Interrupt & The Three Asks
---

What if every prospect you ended up on a call with asks you what you do? In this chapter, that's where we're headed.

The purpose of this chapter is to discuss how we can have an effective and meaningful first call with the prospect. It is our number one coaching request, as you might imagine, and hopefully, we proved in the last chapter that it might not actually be the most important coaching request we get, but it is definitely the most frequent.

That question is, What can you give me to say to a prospect that will improve my chances of getting an appointment off of that conversation?

We definitely believe there are things we can say and do that will produce a much better result. As we stated in Chapter 7, the typical conversion rate from conversation to appointment is five conversations will generate one appointment. Our goal with The Three Asks is to improve that metric.

We want you to have a lot of confidence when you start prospecting. We want you to be armed with a very effective conversation and for you to believe it is your best shot at getting an appointment. This particular skillset will help you be much more confident and reduce call reluctance.

One of our least favorite things about prospecting, especially the colder prospecting that we might be doing, is that moment when a prospect picks up the phone, we just let freedom ring. It makes us just like other salespeople, not just in the insurance world but any salesperson of any type. They wait for the prospect to pick up the phone and then get as much out as possible, hoping that something will stick out to the prospect and the prospect will want to know more.

Sadly, what really happens is that it triggers a response in the prospect that does not help us, and even worse is when we can sense that the prospect is irritated or at least disappointed that they got stuck on the phone with the salesperson. We can and will be able to eliminate that issue by simply using a pattern interrupt and The Three Asks.

Let us begin with talking about the pattern interrupt. The pattern interrupt is simply a tool that we can use so that we are not perceived as a typical salesperson in the opening moments of a sales call. If we use it correctly, we will be able to keep a prospect off balance and also keep them on the phone longer as they're trying to figure out who we are.

In Chapter 8, we discussed how we could approach prospects differently. This part of the prospecting process also needs to be different, and that's where the pattern interrupt comes into play. There are different types of pattern interrupts that we could use, and fortunately, when we're cold calling using a creative drop or running the R.O.O.T.A., the pattern interrupt is built in.

A simple pattern interrupt could be something like, "Hello, my name is Tom Johnson with ABC company. Does my company name ring a bell?"

That simple one is designed for us to avoid just talking fast to get out a lot of information quickly, hoping that something will stick. Another thing about that particular pattern interrupt is that they might not know if you are a client, so they have to stick with you a little bit longer. Every second a prospect stays on the phone helps us. We want to try and avoid their reflexive attempts to get us off the phone, especially in the early seconds of the call. Again, this is a simple pattern interrupt that we can use.

Another type of pattern interrupt that requires a little more skill and confidence (but is highly effective) is to, when the prospect picks up, say something like, "Oh, hi Bob, I wasn't expecting you to pick up the phone. I know you are super busy, and I did not intend to interrupt your day. Would you like me to call you back and leave you a voicemail?"

This seems counterintuitive, but if our goal is not to be perceived as a salesperson at all costs, and in some ways, it is, this is a very effective method to keep your prospect off balance. If they are really busy, we get to leave them a voicemail that can trigger a callback, and it actually helped us that we didn't try to force ourselves on them when they picked up the phone. We have used that particular pattern interrupt many times, and it has worked as well as any. Remember, we're trying to differentiate, and being non-pushy can differentiate you from other people.

An even more aggressive pattern interrupt that we have used many times is when your prospect picks up the phone and says something really bold like, "Hi Bob, my name is Tom, and this is a sales call. Do you want to hang up on me now?" (with a little chuckle)

I know that last one might not be comfortable for most of you, but we have used it many times over the years, and 99% of the time, the response is, "You know, actually, I do want to hang up, but since you were honest, go ahead."

An effective pattern interrupt allows us to slow everything else down on the call as we work through The Three Asks.

Let's talk about a pattern interrupt when we are using a creative drop. When we're using a creative drop, our pattern interrupt is about the actual creative drop itself. We would send Yeti mugs to people years ago and would commonly say as a joke, "I heard you could keep a beer cold for nine hours in that thing, but I haven't been able to make it to nine minutes." Then we could ask them if they had ever heard of a Yeti-if they had one or if they'd ever used one. The point is we would stay on the thing that we dropped on them as long as possible so this would not feel like a normal sales call and would set up the first ask nicely.

When we are doing a pattern interrupt while we are running the R.O.O.T.A., it is around the person that we have in common with the prospect that we're talking to. The more you know about the person you have in common, the longer you can talk about that person and build rapport and trust during that process. No matter what, it won't feel like a traditional salesperson calling someone they don't know.

Once you get really comfortable with a couple of different pattern interrupts you can use and be prepared with, it becomes easy to transition into The Three Asks.

The Three Asks is designed to slow everything down. We ask one question, and we wait for a response. We ask another question, wait for a response, and do that a third time before making a last-ditch effort. The Three Asks is methodical, and we are standing on solid ground the entire time.

As we get ready with the first of the three asks and as you begin to better understand the difference between a transactional Red Ocean
Broker that looks like and talks like everyone else compared to a Blue Ocean Advisor who swims alone and is seen as different and valuable in a unique way, you will understand their focus.

A Red Ocean Broker focuses on themselves and their tools and products and pushes them out toward potential buyers hoping they will buy them. The core of their thinking is their "stuff."

A Blue Ocean Advisor focuses on the relationship with their ideal clients and prospects. Eventually, that may lead to tools and products but only after a thorough understanding of their situation. The core of their thinking is a relationship first; it is always about their client, not themselves.

Because we believe that is true, our first ask will be based on WHO we work with, not WHAT we do. As an example of what I mean, if someone were to ask a Blue Ocean Advisor what they do, their response would be, "I work with CFOs." That may seem odd to you at this point, but we're going to start with who we work with and work our way out to what we do for them.

## The First Ask

Let's pick up this conversation on the first ask after we have done a creative drop; we have gotten a return call and discussed the creative drop as a pattern interrupt.

"Bob, let me explain why I sent that Yeti cup to you specifically. I work with CFOs, and I know you're the CFO of XYZ company. My goal is to set up a 20-minute meeting over the next couple of weeks to share with you some of the work my team and I are doing with the CFOs we work with."

Remember that a major reason that we're using the three asks is to slow this down and hopefully get them to ask us what we do. In this scenario, they might even think we forgot to tell them what we did. It's ok because, as we have found repeatedly, they will likely ask us, "What is it that you do for CFOs?" Which clearly is going to lead us to our second ask.

There are several reasons we want to lead with who we work with as the first ask. One is we want them to know they are the person we need to speak with. If you say to a prospect, we work with "business owners," at some point in the conversation, they might want to kick you down to someone else that really doesn't make the decision but possibly is an information gatherer that could keep you from getting back up the food chain later. We want to keep that from happening as much as possible, and this is one mechanism to help with that. We will be standing on solid ground when they try to kick us down, and we can tell them that what we created, we created for the business owner (or the CEO, CFO, or whomever), not HR or someone else lower on the decision tree.

We really want to make sure that everyone understands how critical this part of the process is. Nothing is worse than getting kicked down to someone who cannot tell you yes but can only tell you no. As a salesperson, you did everything right, except you had the wrong people in the room.

Our goal is to make sure you get them in the room to begin with, and it will transform your closing ratios. Closing ratios have more to do with who you deal with than anything else. If we miss that piece, it doesn't matter how great the rest of your process is; you will lose too many deals.

The second ask has more to do with what you do. It's the reason they should meet with you. In the second ask, we want to make sure we push forward an outcome instead of a thing. We still want them to be curious enough to want to know more, so the goal is to lay out your value proposition in a way that they see it as something valuable but might not be sure what is behind it, and to find that out, they will need to meet.

We can talk through the second ask with or without revealing we are a broker too early. Let's try it first without leading with the fact that we are brokers.

## The Second Ask

Remember the first ask was asking them to meet with you to walk you through what you do for CFOs. And they respond with something like, "Well, what do you do for CFOs?"

A response that doesn't lead with you calling yourself a broker could be, "I consult with CFOs to help them identify financial levers on their healthcare spend that brokers aren't talking about. Are you open to 20 minutes sometime over the next couple of weeks?"

I purposely try to keep them from blocking me with, "They are happy with their current broker." Even if they try, I'm prepared for it. "I want to discuss financial levers brokers aren't bringing to you."

Ask Two could be one of these:

"I consult with business owners to lower their total cost of risk and insurance premiums with unique loss modeling tools we have developed."
"I consult with business owners by benchmarking their insurance premiums against the highest-performing companies in their zip code."
"I consult with CFOs to help them trim the fat out of their healthcare plan, usually to the tune of 15-30%."

There are endless reasons for us to meet, and you need to come up with your favorite until it fits just right. A good way to know if you are on the right track is if they ask you to explain what you are talking about in more detail.

"What do you mean by financial levers?"

## The Third Ask

This leads us to ask number three: We believe in using case stories, and we say stories instead of studies because they should be quick and meaningful. Every producer should have three in their pocket to use when they need them.

The response could be: "Let me give you an example of what I mean by a financial lever. I don't know if this is a financial lever that we will help you pull, but recently we took someone out of their fully insured Blue Cross plan, moved them to a reference-based pricing model, and saved them $600,000. Again, I don't know if that's a lever that we would help you pull, and we can't guess, but our process is designed to help us find the ones that will be the biggest opportunity for you. There are over 40 that we could pull from. Would you be open to meeting for 20 minutes over the next couple of weeks?"

P&C Response: "Well, I'm not sure if this is a financial lever, we will help you pull, and we can't guess what it will be, but recently we took a potential client through our process, and we were able to eliminate 40% of their workers' comp claims using a tool called nurse triage, one of the tools in our post-loss mitigation toolbox. Most people don't even know it exists because brokers aren't talking about it. Again, this is one out of roughly 40 different possible financial levers that you could pull. Would you be open to 20 minutes over the next couple of weeks to see what opportunities are available for you?"

If you're uncomfortable not leading with you are a broker in the second ask, then you can add that by simply saying, "I am a broker, but I am not calling to quote your insurance. I am sure you have a broker you are happy with. Is that correct?" They will likely answer yes to that or something similar to that.

Then we go right into the value proposition: "I thought so; most people are happy, but I am reaching out to discuss financial levers brokers aren't speaking about mainly because they don't understand it. It is the impact of data analytics on your

insurance cost and how to drastically lower premiums using predictive analytics. Has anyone spoken to you about this seismic shift in how insurance is underwritten? Would you be open to 20 minutes to see what opportunities are out there for you by leveraging a modern set of tools like this?"

Whether you lead with "I'm a broker" or wait on that part, it doesn't make a huge difference. It just depends on how "blue ocean" you want to go.

We have a huge database of these types of value propositions and case stories inside our program, and we would recommend that you build a database of these as well. It makes training new people much easier, and everyone in the organization will feel like they're on solid ground when they're out there talking to people about what makes you different.

## Recap

The Pattern Interrupt is designed for you to be perceived as anything but a salesperson very early in the conversation so that you can build rapport and keep the prospect off-balance until your first ask.

Your First Ask is about who you work with-CFOs of Senior Living Facilities, Owners of Construction Companies, etc. The more industry-focused you can be, the better off you are.

Your Second Ask is about differentiating you from the typical broker by talking about things brokers aren't. The more your value is tied to benchmarking, unique financial levers, one-of-a-kind toolbox, etc., the more effective it will be for them to want more.

Your Third Ask is about using case stories to substantiate your claims of better outcomes.

Each one creates an opportunity to ask for a twenty-minute meeting to see what opportunities exist for them. The simpler the premise, the more effective it will be. You don't want them to have too much to think about. We want them to ask themselves, Do I want to know about unique financial levers that brokers aren't bringing me to lower my costs?

As a last-ditch effort, we can ask them if they ever have someone take a look at their program, and if so, when would that be, and what can we do to be put on the list of people to help them evaluate it? I also like to tell them we typically start 90 days before anyone else does because some of the most effective financial levers can't be pulled if we wait too long.

Lastly, sometimes we just have to hang in there a little bit longer. That is where the mindset of being an effective prospector really comes into play.

We know we have presented a lot of information in this book with ideas that range from how to open a conversation, differentiating on a first appointment, getting them into a discovery meeting, and how to create value in your proposal in a unique way. We hope you have found the principles in this book meaningful and easy to follow, but more than that, we hope you join others on this journey of building a massive book of business by becoming a Blue Ocean Advisor.
