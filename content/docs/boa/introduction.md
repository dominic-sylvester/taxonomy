There are two types of salespeople: the transactional salesperson and the trusted advisor. While both aim to close deals and generate revenue, the approach and mindset of each is vastly different. A transactional salesperson is focused on making a sale at any cost, often resorting to high-pressure tactics to push products or services onto customers. In contrast, a trusted advisor prioritizes building relationships, understanding customer needs, and providing solutions that are tailored to their unique requirements.

As the sales landscape becomes increasingly more competitive, it can be easy to lose sight of what truly matters-helping people. Customers are inundated with options and are wary of traditional sales tactics. They want to work with salespeople who they can trust, listen to their needs, and provide valuable insights and advice.
