description: Why Doesn't Every Producer Have A Million-Dollar Book Of Business?
type: Doc
---

Our firm has worked with thousands of producers over the last 20+ years. Our goal is always to help a producer accomplish whatever his or her wildest dreams are from this business, and it's interesting to see some people respond with motivation and creativity to reach their goals while others seem to just get stuck.

Everyone that works with our firm knows that our favorite book is The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. The whole idea behind the book is that action advances action. We live in America. We've got it made. Some may say we are soft.

Why do I say that? Because when you have it really good, what happens is, when you run into an obstacle, you tend to shrink from the obs-tacle. But know this, every producer reading this book can make $400,000 or $500,000 a year within three to ten years of getting into the business.

Why do we know that? Because we've seen it so often. Why is it that a lot of people aren't making that kind of money? Why is it that a lot of people don't have million-dollar or higher books? We have actually been studying this for many years.

We have been working inside agencies and alongside producers for over 20 years, and what we've learned is there are five reasons that not all producers have million-dollar books or higher. When you hear about these people with a $5 million revenue book or a $10 million revenue book, they're specialists at breaking through these obstacles. If you practice what we teach you in this book, you can break through each one of these bar-riers. We'll list them briefly, and then we will break each of them down for you.

We will discuss in this book practical applications to blow up every one of these obstacles so that when you're done, you will know that the impediment to action does advance action and that "the obstacle is the way," to quote Ryan Holiday.

The five obstacles/bottlenecks that we're all trying to continue to break through are:

1. Expectations or vision — Low expectations or a lack of real vision for my future.
2. Time — "If I just had more time."
3. Who do I call on? — Very few producers have a meaningful list and don't really understand their ideal buyer.
4. What do I say to get in front of them? - Simply getting more people to call me back and then getting them to meet with me.
5. What needs to happen to get hired? - Are you in the Blue Ocean (authentically different) or Red Ocean (same as everyone else)?

## Bottleneck number 1: Expectations/Vision

This is going to seem so obvious. People don't wake up with $4 million books of business. They have this vision for what it would look like to have that book of business. Let me give you an example of how critical this is for you to lay out how big of a book you want in ten years, where you need to be in three years to get there, and then what your one-year goals are.

A guy reached out to us, admitting to having some level of call reluctance when prospecting. We were impressed by his level of self-awareness and soon after arranged for him to take an assessment called SPQ Gold. If you know anything about SPQ Gold, you know that the premise is that we were not born with call reluctance; it's actually a learned behavior. And so if it's learned, it can be unlearned.

After taking the test, we went over the results with one of the test interpreters, and I'll always remember what it revealed. If we were to ask you where call reluctance comes from, your answer would most likely be "fear of rejection" or something similar.

His number one reason for call reluctance was he had no long-term vision or goals for his business. The person that proctors the exam let us know a truth for most producers-nobody wants to prospect. Prospecting is something you have to do, similar to athletes not wanting to go to two-a-days, but that is what they have to do. They don't want to go to practice every day, but they want to play under the Friday night lights, and they want to play in Super Bowls. The bottom line is if we don't get this vision right, we will never reach our full potential or ever enjoy this business as much as we could.

Almost everything else about this book is going to be about your prospects and how to help them. This vision component is deeply personal.

What do you want out of this business? Where do you want to be in three years and then ten years? Understanding those things will help define your one-year revenue goal.

Share your personal vision with your significant other and other important people in your life, including your mentors and close friends.

Every decision we make should be filtered through the lens of where we want to be.

Sales and prospecting can be very difficult, and we get beat up frequently-we expect it. We're not going to shrink from it. We're going to run toward it, not away from it. Why? Our vision propels us forward despite the obstacle. This whole book could be about vision, but we know you've got to have your expectations and vision right, or nothing else matters.

In summary, a powerful vision for your future is the fuel in your furnace of desire. If you really want to get it right, don't think about your future in terms of what you think you can do but what you really want out of life and your business.

## Bottleneck number 2: Time

The next bottleneck people run into is thinking they've run out of time. The truth is that we would have never seen $5, $10, $15, or $20 million revenue books of business if time were actually the problem. Time isn't the problem. The problem really goes back to the lack of vision. With the correct vision, we can continue to look for a way around or through the obstacle to continue to grow our books.

Everybody gets busy in this business. It becomes really simple. How do you get to be so busy? The primary reasons we routinely see are:

1. Too many accounts.
2. Too much service work and/or not delegating lower-level tasks.

We know that the Pareto Principle is a very simple way to blow up the time bottleneck. You may know the Pareto Principle by its more common name, the 80/20 rule. The 80/20 rule simply highlights that 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your accounts, and the inverse is also true, that 80% of your accounts are generating 20% of your revenue.

Many years ago, we had an engagement in Southern California. We mention this one because it was a glaringly obvious example of the power of understanding the impact of the Pareto Principle.

The new client was a $5 million revenue agency. Before we could get to the conversation about growth, which was why they hired us, they told us they had a bigger problem. They let us know that they did not feel like they had any capacity to grow. That seemed like a funny thing to be sharing since they had already paid us to help them ramp up organic growth.

They shared that all of their service people were overwhelmed serving their clients. Recognizing that this was an agency of roughly $5 million in revenue, we asked them to take their largest 1,000 customers and their smallest 1,000 customers and tell us how much of their revenue was being driven in each. We asked them to pretend they could put all their 1,000 largest customers in one file cabinet and the 1,000 of their smallest customers in the other.

We then asked them how much revenue was in each file cabinet. It was eye-opening. Their top 1,000 customers generated $4,750,000.

Their smallest 1,000 customers in the other file cabinet only generated $250,000. Again, the smallest half was only $250,000 in revenue, and the largest was just short of $5 million.

They sold those accounts to a friendly competitor later that day.

We asked them why they sold that book. We could have done other things with those accounts. Their answer was very revealing. They said that every day their employees walk in those two front doors (they pointed at them), and "there is only one way we know of that our employees will no longer work on accounts that are so small that a thousand of them only generate $250,000 in revenue, and that is to get rid of those accounts."

Maybe we remember this so vividly because they sold the book of business before we ever left. That's understanding the obstacle and executing the way to overcome it quickly!

This might seem like a stretch, but when people tell us they have a time problem, we believe they have a vision problem.

What do we mean by that? You can find every excuse for why you can't figure out what to do with a small customer that really shouldn't be in your book of business anymore. We know they are a cancer to growth at the producer and enterprise levels.

If your vision is strong enough and you want that multi-million-dollar book because of what it will do for you and your family, you will figure out a way to get those small accounts out of it. The Pareto Principle makes it a practical reality, but without a crystal-clear vision, most people won't leverage it.

## Bottleneck number 3: "Who do I call on?"

When we were younger, we can both remember our mom talking about making dinner, which she did almost every night.

She would say, "I don't really mind making dinner. It's coming up with what I'm going to make that is difficult." I think that is very much like

Bottleneck number three: "Who do I call on?" How does that bottleneck show up? Your prospect list is old or tired.

You may or may not know that you can build a fantastic prospect list off Sales Navigator within LinkedIn. We will talk later in the book about running the R.Ö.Ö.I.A. (Referral Öut of Thin Air). We believe a salesperson not having Linkedin Sales Navigator is akin to a carpenter not having a hammer. There is MiEdge and other free and paid sites to build prospect lists as well.

The main thing we really want to introduce here is that we've worked with some fabulous producers with multimillion-dollar books that take this very seriously and EVERY Friday at 9:00 a.m., without fail, tend to their list. They care for it like a master gardener tending to their prize rose bushes.

A simple tip for building a great list is to pick a vertical or two. By shrinking your world, it becomes easier to create a more meaningful list.
Also, make sure you are adding the person that you want to meet or get in front of, not just the company name. We are in the people business, not the company business.

Now it's time for a really good story that we can tell around the first three bottlenecks. This is a story about a young man who we met around 2010. He had been in the business for just under three years, had roughly a $350,000 revenue book, and he wanted to grow immediately. When we got to know this guy, we realized that he had very high expectations for the future. That gets people like us excited because we know people who are motivated to do something special for themselves will do much better than those who are trying to live up to a sales manager's expectations. He had an event in his life that created an important reason for him to need to basically double his book in one year. In our early conversations, we wanted to understand how many accounts he felt confident he could write, and he said he could probably write ten accounts this year.

In his first year, he had written 12, but he called on anybody that would let him fog up their glasses to achieve that. He felt he could write ten accounts partly because there were a few holdovers from previous years he could possibly write in the near future. We asked him what his average account size was; it was $20,000 in revenue, and he wanted to write $400,000 this year. The math was pretty simple. He had to double his average account size if he wanted to reach this goal of $400,000 in revenue in a single year. One of the tweaks we made was that we took him from his average account size of $20,000 to $40,000, which became very important for him to be able to achieve his goal. Another thing we did was start to discuss who he needed to be calling on, not just the size of the account, but who to reach out to inside of the business. When we noticed his closing ratio was lower than it should have been, we realized that he was calling on somebody inside a business who could not tell him yes. We then switched the buyer, the type of person that he was calling on, from an HR person to a CFO. Our goal wasn't to alienate HR but to start looping in someone higher on the food chain.

Immediately, his results started to get much, much better. He not only hit that $400,000 revenue goal about four months in, he surpassed it. Since then, he has gone on to build a multi-million-dollar book, and this all started because he had really high expectations. We tweaked the type of business he was going after in terms of their size and who the buyer type was on the inside, which radically transformed how he approached the first three bottlenecks. The exercises we put him through really pushed him to think differently, and his ultimate vision coming out of that year was to have a $5 million revenue book by the time he was 40. He would have achieved his goals without us, but we are fortunate we got to help him shortcut that process potentially by many years.

## Bottleneck Number 4: "What do I say or do to get in front of a decision-maker?"

Our number one coaching request would be to understand what to say to a buyer when we finally get one on the phone. What do I say to get them to be more likely to meet with me? We're going to actually move you a little further back in the continuum of getting in front of a new opportunity and look at a very different metric. People always want to focus on the conversation to appointment metric, which we do agree is very important.
But in 20 years of working with producers, studying seasoned producers, and thousands of new producers that our clients have hired, we've realized there's a different metric that we're going to ask you to focus on. It's a huge bottleneck to growth, and it is this: the attempts to conversation. This is simply how many dials it takes to get someone to call you back or get put through by the gatekeeper. We're going to show you how to take that from a 20 to 1 metric to a 5 to 1 metric or better and start getting into conversations with a lot more people.

We're also going to tweak the things that we would recommend that you talk about on a prospecting call. So many producers say the exact same thing instead of actually talking about something different. And we get it because, in the world that you are in, many of your tools and resources are the same. And so that kind of dictates what you're going to talk about. We're going to adjust that a little bit later in the book for you to really feel confident. First of all, we will help you to drastically improve your metrics from attempts to conversations and then with your conversation to appointment metric so that you feel like you will get a better result for your effort. You're going to get a much better result for the amount of time you spend. This bottleneck is the one that we get the most requests for help to overcome, and that's because it is the most difficult one. We believe one reason it is so much harder to prospect as an insurance advisor compared to a traditional salesperson is because of the strength of some of these incumbent relationships.

For every account we're going after, there's somebody on the other side of it that wants to keep it because they're being paid a renewal on it.
Again, it makes it exponentially more difficult. As you already likely know, some of the most common reasons that you're not going to get in front of an opportunity is that a prospect is going to say to you, "I'm happy with my current broker," or "I don't have time for that right now," or "I'm all set," or "I'm not looking at that this year." They're treating you as a transaction or a commodity because you are in the red ocean. We're going to try to change the conversation for you to overcome these common objections. Even better, let's take the bat out of their hands before they even swing it.

## Bottleneck number 5: What needs to happen to get hired?

Once we actually get in front of a prospect for the first time, what happens in that meeting is going to determine the path we take moving forward. Will it be their transactional process that throws you into the red ocean where you look and sound just like everyone else, or will you be able to lay out a better path that is different from their normal process that turns you into a commodity?

They want this to be transactional. They're trying to define us in a certain way and it limits the impact that we can have on their business. This is not on purpose; they're just used to buying insurance a certain way. They want us to follow their process because it's just the way they have always done it. Sadly, it doesn't help them, or us, to follow their process, and it is our job to introduce a better one, which, if they follow it, will generate a better set of outcomes for them and likely for us as well.

Let us give you an example of a client that transitioned to this different way of thinking where the quote/bid was not something she did on every deal. She said, "Look, I close 30% of the deals I work on, and it takes about 40 hours to get all the spreadsheets done. Everything that we do in a deal takes about 40 hours, and we close 30% of them."

Fast-forward one year. When she went to the method we will share with you in this book, she went from 30% closing ratios to 70-80%. And the time it took to get the deal closed was six hours instead of 40 hours, and she used a broker of record letter.

By the end of this book, you will learn how to lead to your tools, not with your tools. We will be doing things in their proper order, and the focus is going to be on your prospect, not you and all your stuff. We will take you out of the middle of your presentation and put them in the middle.

We want you to understand that the Holy Grail in sales is for you to get real buyers to be open and honest with you about their situation and what they want to see happen. If we do this correctly, we will not only write the account, but we will write it quicker and, in many cases, not have to give everything away to do it.

In short, we want you to be preoccupied with what you want to know about them, not what you want them to know about you.
