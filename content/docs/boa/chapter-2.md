title: Chapter Two
description: The Foundation And Fundamentals Of Becoming A Trusted, Successful Advisor
---

As we worked side by side with salespeople our whole careers, we have this really unique vantage point where we get to meet people who just do it differently than others. It's really exciting when that happens. We don't believe we are gurus. We believe we're interested in studying this and getting our Ph.D. in sales and prospecting, and we study the gurus and great salespeople.

We read the books, and we have coaches ourselves that we believe make us better. We're going to get really tactical as the book advances, but for now, we would be making a big mistake if we didn't share with you the fundamental principles that the Blueprint rests upon. If you don't understand these, you'll probably struggle tactically with how we do something later in the book or the "why" behind how we might do something. We want to begin with a concept that we call "The Two Pitfalls" that all salespeople deal with and typically aren't very effective at overcoming.

We believe that, as insurance advisors, it's an even bigger problem than most salespeople outside of the industry have to endure because of the really strong incumbent relationships that your prospects have.

Let's discuss Sales Pitfall Number One.

Sales Pitfall number one is that our prospects believe that we will say anything or do anything to win their business. If you think about it, if prospects believed everything we said as salespeople, this would be a really easy job. We could make a lot of money if people always believed everything we told them.

They don't believe it for good reason. We've all been buyers. When a salesperson says something that is self-serving, we can sense that everything that comes out of their mouth will be to their benefit, and we have to deal with that.

This idea that prospects believe that salespeople will say anything or do anything to win their business is a huge issue. This may seem like a simple thing, but even when we show up to a meeting and we thank a prospect for spending time with us, we automatically begin to subordinate ourselves to them, and we give cues or hints that their time is more valuable than ours. Now, I'm not saying that to be rude by any stretch of the imagination. I would just be careful thanking people for their time. First, it does subordinate us, and secondly, (I see this all the time riding with producers for 15 years) they just show up as different people in a prospect meeting than they are normally.

It's this really flowery kind of church greeter kind of mentality that we see that creates a problem. It actually causes a buyer's resistance to go up instead of bringing it down. In fact, we were riding with a producer six or seven years ago, and he was highly technically trained. He came from the insurance company side. He was very well-liked by everyone that knew him.

For some reason, he could not win a deal. His agency leadership reached out to us and said, "We want you to come ride with him to see if there's anything that jumps out at you." So we hopped in the car with him and went to an appointment. We quickly realized that this guy's problem was that he had become very different from the one we all knew and loved. Once he got live in front of a new prospect, we think the best way to describe it would be he came across like a church greeter, and it was bothersome. It was so over the top.

We thought we needed to go to a nursing home and let him go room to room. They would love that personality there. It's not coming across very well on a sales call, though. We remember one of the comments he said was, "First of all, Mr. And Mrs. Prospect, we're honored that you would meet with us." We remember thinking, Wow, that is really turning it on thick. The fact that he said he was "honored" that they would meet with him. Real people don't do this in real life, and he didn't normally act this way either, and it was hurting him.

On a humorous note, we did find out after that sales call on the way back to the office that the salesperson was, in fact, a greeter at his
church.

We think we are helping ourselves, but the opposite is achieved; it actually hurts us. We would rather you just be yourself and say something simple when you're going to meet a prospect for the first time. "Hey, I've been looking forward to the meeting." Or "It's nice to put a face with the name."

The more effective we are at eliminating sales pitfall number one, the better off we will be, and we do it by introducing ideas that lower buyers' resistance, not raise it. It could be something simple like, "We don't know if it makes sense for us to do business together moving forward, but we're here to see if there's a fit and see if there are any opportunities to work together."

That neutral type of language is automatically going to set you up better to avoid falling victim to pitfall number one as opposed to being overly nice, lighting the sparklers with a presentation that is like everyone else's: too salesy or overly grateful for the opportunity.

Be more neutral when you're meeting with the prospect for the first time by being preoccupied with what you want to know about them, not what you want them to know about you. Let me repeat that. Be preoccupied with what you want to know about them, not what you want them to know about you. If you bring some "give a damn" to the table and take an interest in them right out of the gate, they will sense that about you, and they will open up to you. They will tell you what you need to know to help them and be able to create value for them—AND FOR YOU.

Let's discuss Sales Pitfall Number Two.

Sales pitfall number two is that our prospects decide our value before they ever really know it. That comes into play probably more in the prospecting phase than at any other time in the sales continuum because we have this desire to tell them what we do, and then they think/say, "Oh, I have one of you already, and I really like them" or "I'm not going to meet with you because I don't have to because I know what you do" ... BUT they really don't know what you do. We create this effect by the way that we approach initially, by leading with "I'm a broker," which is the most fortified position you could approach them with. We don't use these exact words, but to the prospect, it sounds something like this, "I want to be your broker. I know you have a broker, but I'm better than your broker."

This produces an automatic rejection most of the time. Again, it's why we call it the most fortified position. We will discuss later how to use curiosity and reciprocity to get into many more conversations with prospects than traditional methods.

Let's discuss another foundational concept known as the "Change Formula."

The Change formula was documented and simplified by a person named David Gleicher. If you would like to Google Gleicher's formula for change, you will be able to find out more about it and see its origins. This was not introduced to us as a concept that would impact our ability to be more effective salespeople, but we knew intuitively when we saw The Change Formula that it would have an impact on writing more business.

Here's how the formula reads: D multiplied by V multiplied by F is greater than R (DxVxF>R). The D stands for dissatisfaction, the V stands for vision for the future, and the F stands for first concrete steps. The R stands for resistance to change.

Like an algebraic equation, any of the variables on the left have an assigned value of zero to ten. Our goal is to have close to ten on each of these variables by the time we are at the proposal stage. If any of these variables is zero, then we will not have enough to overcome their resistance to change. Here's what The Change Formula is trying to tell us. If someone is going to overcome their resistance to change, there are three variables on the left side of the equation that are necessary for them to be able to do that, and each needs an assigned value. They have to be dissatisfied, have a powerful vision for the future, and first concrete steps that are not too complicated.

The first variable on the left side of the equation is dissatisfaction. What we mean is that a prospect has to be dissatisfied with their current situation if they are going to "change." As a salesperson, I have to understand if a prospect is not going to quickly admit to me where they're dissatisfied in their current situation, then my job is to create it. A typical producer may ask somebody, "Are you happy with your current broker?" Or "Are you happy with your current insurance program?" That's the producer's way of trying to figure out whether the prospect is dissatisfied with their current situation. In most cases, they're not dissatisfied, or at least early on, they are not willing to admit they are, so it becomes almost a worthless question. The prospect may tell us that they are unhappy because they want to get a quote/bid from us, and they have to be able to tell us they are unhappy or that "they aren't married to their broker" so they can get what they want. That way, we'll go ahead and give our quote/bid, even though their intention is never to hire us. As we move forward in this book, we will discuss how to effectively get a dissatisfied prospect.

Within The Change Formula, variable number two of the left side of the equation is vision for the future. We love to look ahead two years with a prospect and just simply learn from them, if all things were possible, what they would like to see happen over the next two years. What outcomes would they like to see come to pass that aren't happening right now?
\Often, a really good vision casting session with the prospect can create a lot of dissatisfaction. Maybe they weren't that dissatisfied when the conversation started, but when they start telling us what they would really like to see happen, they get excited about the future and automatically become more dissatisfied with what is going on now.

Another great thing about casting vision with a prospect is when we do that, we get attached to that vision. They know that we can help them get there, and they see us as a part of the vision we just helped them create.

Part of our role as an advisor is to know what's possible. It's not only what they answer for us when we ask them about the vision question, it's also based on our wisdom and understanding to help them know what's possible. Have you considered this outcome before? More often than not, they say, "No, we haven't. We didn't know someone like you could help us do that." So, vision casting becomes this really important piece. In fact, within the Blueprint model, we would never give someone a proposal that we didn't understand what their two or three-year vision was about. What opportunities did they want to pursue that they weren't experiencing right now?

We would not give a proposal without that question being answered. We would also not give a proposal to a prospect without understanding where they were dissatisfied in their current situation. It could be a simple thing that we start with a vision and then ask them what roadblocks could keep that vision from happening, and that may be where their dissatisfaction is at its highest point.

We are very positive people around Blueprint headquarters. It would be hard for us to admit something we might be "dissatisfied" about, but we are more likely to admit something that we wish was different or something that we're frustrated with. There are different words we can use to get people talking, and we will continue to unpack those as we progress in the book. Hopefully, we can begin to see documenting where a prospect is dissatisfied, and their vision for the future are two really important pieces to us closing more business.

As stated earlier, the third component is "first concrete steps." Often, when producers present a proposal, there can be many tools and moving parts in a work comp program or an employee benefits program, etc. If we're not careful, it can be seen as too difficult, and the prospect might say, "This has been great, and you've given us a lot to think about." That is obviously not a good response, and we will show you how to deal with a proposal with many tools and capabilities you are bringing to the table. We will show you how to simplify your proposal and keep the focus on the outcomes instead of the "stuff," especially at the close.

If you will embrace The Change Formula, it is the closest thing to sales magic that we can come up with to help people understand all the boxes they need to check to be able to win a piece of business. It's always on our minds as salespeople when we are riding with producers. We once went on a sales call with a young producer, and it was about a 600-life group. We were meeting with the CFO. She was very sharp, and we knew right away that she was smarter than us and wouldn't be "sold" anything. A few minutes into the meeting, we asked her, like we do in the early moments of any sales call, "Is there anything that you want to make sure that we discuss? Let's begin there so we don't run out of time — ultimately, this is about you, not us. We have some things that are important to us, that we think matter, but we want to start with what you want to talk about.""\*\*

Her response was, "I've been working with my current broker for nine years, and for the first six years, they were amazing, but for the last three years, they have not been hitting the bullseye."

A really funny part of this story to us is in that moment, the young producer I was with (because often our instincts are bad and the two pitfalls of salespeople came into play) responded with, "You don't have to worry about that with us, we know how to hit the bullseye. We're known for it (Blah, blah, blah)." We were able to redirect the conversation, but only because The Change Formula was on our minds. I asked her, "Can you tell us what your bullseye is?" Interestingly, she did not give us her bullseye. What she started doing instead was talking about all the different ways that she was dissatisfied with her current broker. From there, it was very easy for us to transition into another meeting to really unpack these issues in a deeper way. It was super simple to be able to document where she was dissatisfied. In the next meeting, we jumped into her vision for the future, and it made the process so much easier for us to be able to showcase our tools and resources through the backdrop of her very own formula for change that she gave us.

Continuing on with the fundamentals of being a Blue Ocean Advisor, let's look at how to effectively differentiate yourself from others.

It's easy to differentiate when we're comparing (as opposed to pitching). Maybe the only way to really differentiate is by comparing one thing to something else. It is difficult to differentiate between your tools and your ideas because we're just talking to prospects about how great a tool is or how great a resource is, how great our service team is, or whatever it may be that we find ourselves talking about all the time. We all know the feeling when we pitch that way when we look at our prospect and their eyes gloss over. It is difficult to differentiate while we're turning on a laser light show or when we're talking about the same things that other brokers talk about too.

Sadly, even people not in this industry use similar PowerPoints that are not that different from yours. The PowerPoint basically says, We're amazing, and here's why you should hire us. Whether it's a landscaper, a contractor, or an accountant, it doesn't matter. All these Power Points are the same. It is very difficult to differentiate when we are swimming in the red ocean, looking and sounding like everyone else, bloodying each other up over price.

In this book, we are proposing you approach this a different way than pitching and quoting. Instead of leading with tools and capabilities and carriers and market pressure, lead with a set of outcomes the prospect should be getting that we know they aren't getting (think of it as a comparison of outcomes instead of a comparison of stuff).

If we do this effectively, we aren't so vulnerable to everything getting funneled back through the incumbent for them to get the last look and be able to meet it or beat our proposal. So many producers have been run out of this business because they followed that model. That's why we're trying to set up a different way to differentiate. As Sandler Training disciples, we learned many years ago that when it comes to differentiation, nothing is good or bad, better or worse, except by comparison.

We have to be able to compare what's possible (vision) against how they're currently doing things. When we do that effectively, then we are differentiating effectively.
We mentioned earlier that it's difficult to differentiate in the tools and ideas realm. Surely you have heard the phrase "Ideas are a dime a dozen," and we have seen how everybody's PowerPoints are the same. So where we differentiate every single time is the execution layer, the results layer, otherwise known as the "outcomes" layer.

A prospect is much more likely to admit they're not getting an outcome than they are to admit to needing to use a certain tool that you might find valuable. When we talk about differentiation, we've got to get down into the "outcome" layer. If you don't agree with us on this premise, then it will be difficult for you to embrace how we navigate the process that we will discuss in later chapters.

We would commonly say to a prospect, "Tell me about the financial process you use to evaluate your insurance spend. How do you know that you're getting the best deal possible with that process? What are you comparing that to?" So, when we get down into that layer of execution, it's impossible for them to make up a process they don't have. Regardless of the topic, we want them to "walk us through your process," which is so much more powerful than a typical open-ended question.

If you want to be different, talk about different things. Differentiation stems from this idea that nothing is good or bad, better or worse, except by comparison. Remember this concept. We don't lead with our tools; we lead to our tools.

Your tools are important; let's just make sure we insert them at the right time and place, and that will be later in the process. Your tools help achieve important outcomes, so let's discuss the outcomes first (something they likely aren't getting), then let's discuss the tools inside of our execution process that gets to the outcome. We will have more on this in later chapters of the book.

We have looked at many different tools that brokers use over the last 20 years. We have noticed that there are only six or seven outcomes that all of them create, so let's talk about the outcome, and then the tool will become valuable later. If they don't want the outcome that the tool creates, they don't want the tool. We're much more likely to be able to get them to embrace our tools if we can first get them to embrace the problem that a tool solves or an outcome that they help create.

To continue the fundamental elements of being a Blue Ocean Advisor, let's discuss what we refer to as the Holy Grail in Sales.

Every guru we talk to or read or learn from personally would all teach the same thing, and I mean the best of the best. The true geniuses in the sales world would all tell us the same thing:

**_The holy grail in sales is getting real buyers open and honest with you about their current situation and what they would like to see happen._**

If you want higher closing ratios, if you want to be meaningful to your prospects that will then become clients, if you want to get more referrals and all that comes with that, the holy grail in all of this is to get real buyers to be open and honest with us.

About what? Well, about what we need to know the answers to. This is such a crucial piece of this model we are unveiling to you. First of all, it needs to be a real buyer that can tell you yes, instead of just no. Information gatherers can tell us no but not tell us yes. If you want to improve performance and build wealth in this business, you must develop the skill of getting in front of and differentiating with real decision-makers.

If you take one thing out of this book and want your closing ratios to go up, you need to start calling on people who can tell you yes. So many salespeople and producers, especially in this industry, take someone through their sales process, create a proposal, and yet they don't win the deal. Sadly, it isn't because their process wasn't good. It was because they were calling on the wrong person. The person they dealt with could never tell them yes. They can only tell them no. It's a huge problem. It's a difficult problem to get solved without conscious effort.

Remember bottleneck #3 from chapter one was, "Who do I call on?" You've got to make sure it's somebody that's actually in the decision tree. Get that right and save yourself a lot of heartache. The second part of the holy grail in sales is to get them open and honest with you. We realized as young salespeople that if a prospect was not going to talk to us, if they weren't going to answer our questions, then they were not going to hire us.

As we progress in the process of this book, we are going to give you many important questions to ask that are important for you to know. Equally as important: is your prospect willing to give you the answer? If they aren't, then that is valuable intel for you as you decide if this prospect has a good intent (remember their intent might be for us to get them a quote and not ever intend on hiring us). Not only do they need to talk to us, but they also need to tell us the truth. We're going to introduce you to some questions that we know they will not have a good answer for, and because they don't have a good answer, it's obvious to everyone they aren't performing as well as they could be.

Remember, we have to be able to get real buyers engaged. They have to open up to us even early in the conversation, especially once we get to phase two of the sales process, where it's all about them talking to us in a "discovery" type setting. Remember that the Blueprint process is built for prospects to open up to you with everything that you need to know to help them. As we move forward, we want to be preoccupied with what we want to know about them, not preoccupied with what we want them to know about us (that will come later).

Let's discuss another fundamental piece of being a Blue Ocean Advisor, and that is the "ideal client" way of thinking.

The ideal client model has changed our lives, as well as many others. Our coach and mentor, Curtis Verstraete of On Purpose IP, has spent countless hours helping us think through this over the years. You can also read about this in a book called Book Yourself Solid," by Michael Port. When we go out for an initial appointment to meet with any prospect, there are all kinds of ways we've been taught to qualify a prospect. A simple part of our ideal client profile is we want to see if they will just talk to us and will they open up to us? There are many more pieces to the ideal client model, including how we market ourselves to attract the prospects that we want, but once we enter into dialogue with a prospect for the first time, that requires a different mindset and skillset. Their answering our questions is a simple criterion anyone can add to their ideal client profile immediately.

Another one, and maybe a bigger one, is: will they let us do our best work with them? Ultimately that will lead us to a process for a prospect to go through to get a better set of outcomes. Again, we will unpack this more in the book as we progress, and you will see how we tactically get a prospect to go through it with you. When they agree to it you are automatically put into a high closing ratio situation.

One of the biggest decisions a salesperson can make is to walk away from somebody that's not an ideal client, and that begins with, Are they willing to answer your questions and tell you the truth? Doing this will speed up your revenue growth and make you happier in the long run.

What we've learned is that if we only spend our time with ideal prospects and ideal clients, we love what we do much more. We feel affirmed, and we feel positive. We have the confidence level it takes to prospect daily.

In the ideal client model, your clients will also value you differently, and they will open up all of their relationships to you because you're different. They'll trust that they can do that for you. Yet, if we step outside of our value system on what an ideal client is, then that's when we get into trouble and won't like our job as much, and our clients won't like us as much.

Let's look at another fundamental attribute of a Blue Ocean advisor by contrasting the difference between a salesperson and an advisor.

In our careers, we have spent a lot of time trying to understand what an insurance salesperson or insurance advisor is all about. We heard this statement from our client, who said, "I want to be perceived as a trusted advisor." We thought, Wow, what a great thing to want to be. Let's work toward that. Let everything we do point in that direction.

Then we would go ride with producers that wanted to be seen and heard as trusted advisors, and we would walk away thinking that we were not exactly sure what an advisor does, but we have a feeling that what we just witnessed was not it. This information dump on how amazing I am and how amazing my firm is, for some reason, not what we had in mind when we heard from clients that they wanted to be seen as an advisor. We are fortunate to have worked with people that laugh alongside us as we figure things out.

We began researching and studying what an advisor really is. We had some clients that we really felt embodied the "advisor" title. We also met Curtis Verstraete of On Purpose IP. He was way ahead of us, and he had a model for an advisory process. It changed everything for us when we were able to see exactly what an advisor should be doing if they really are an advisor. We would always ask salespeople, trying to determine the difference between a salesperson and an advisor. In fact, in our workshops, a standard exercise is to get participants to give us adjectives to describe a salesperson, and we would get very common answers that you might expect-very self-focused-type answers. They're talkative, pushy, and they really are not concerned about what's in it for the buyer. They care about the commission they're trying to get and those types of descriptions. After asking participants to describe a salesperson, we asked them to describe an advisor. We heard very different answers, such as, "They care about their clients." "They're unbiased about what's in it for themselves." "They're objective, and they provide real solutions."

Now, again, one of the reasons that an advisor often can do that is because they have already been paid or at least that has been decided already. Whether it's an attorney or a doctor or a CPA or whomever, they're probably already being paid, or maybe even that's been discussed. They know what they're going to get paid, so they can be truly unbiased about the solution. Here is what we found; hopefully, you will find this good news. We can determine if they see us as a salesperson or as an advisor based on the same criteria. We're either going to be trusted, client-centric, objective and highly paid, or we're going to be self-centric and talk about our products and features, trying to close all the time with a focus on our commission. We're going to determine whether or not they see us as an advisor or as a salesperson. The primary takeaway that we want you all to be thinking about after having studied this for 20 years is if you want to be perceived as an advisor, the best way to get people to be open and honest with you and to tell you what's on their mind, is for you to be objective about what is in it for you or maybe even better, quit worrying about what's in it for you. On the other end, stop worrying about whether or not you get paid, and you will be much more likely to get paid.

The idea behind that is if you're going to serve a prospect out of their own need, they're going to let you do your best work with them, and you're going to come up with better solutions. The closing ratios go through the roof. The relationships that we have and the referrals that we get when we approach it this way become exponentially more important.

So again, it's not enough that we simply have this belief of being objective about what's in it for us that makes us an advisor. We know where to look to help people. For example, think about a doctor. If you went to the doctor, what would you do if they wheeled in a cart with a projector on it and had a Power Point about where they went to medical school and how much better their stethoscopes are than other doctors, and how their x-ray machines were better? Then they began to brag about how their nurses and service team were superior. What if they said, "Hey, at one time we were a really small firm, and now we're a part of 'Bigger and Better Broker' or we are members of 'A Bunch of Us Association, and we picked up even better resources"? Just how odd would that be? As an industry, we do that all the time with our PowerPoints.

In another way, how odd would it be for a doctor to walk into the lobby and start guessing what people might need to be prescribed? Prescribing medication or treatments before an examination would lead to trouble. We may try to shove a capsule down somebody's throat of self-funding, or some piece of technology, a certain insurance company that we partner well with or whatever it may be. That is not the role of an ad-visor, and it's certainly not a Blue Ocean. We do that all the time in our world, but that is not the way an advisor operates, is it?

Keep in mind, as you move forward, that you must be objective about what's in it for you. You need to know where to look. You won't start the relationship talking about yourself like a salesperson would. Doctors take patients into an examination room and begin to understand their current situation, what kind of trouble they're having, and what they are struggling with. Only then do they start making recommendations. That is what advisors do. That's what the Blueprint process is going to enable you to do. Let's discuss a universal set of steps that all advisors follow. Whether you use these words or not doesn't matter, but all advisors follow an advisory process.

Step one is "discovery."
Step two is "planning."
Step three is "implementation."
Step four is "progress review."

You don't have to call each stage what we call it. "Discovery" could be "review" or "audit." You get the idea. These are just four words that we use to explain a universal set of steps that make up an advisory process - discovery, planning, implementation, and review.

So now that it's not enough that we have this process that you can follow, and you can look at Graphic 2.1 (below), a sample process that we would actually show a prospect. We ask them to go through this with us so that we can understand their situation better. We make it clear that we're going to be able to make recommendations once we understand their situation better, and we'll show them a set of tools that they likely haven't seen before to help them in their current situation achieve the vision that they are trying to work toward.

<Image src="/images/CHAPTER-TWO/1.jpg" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />

There's a sample picture of it on Graphic 2.1, but it's not enough that we have an advisory process. Advisors don't veer from the process either. They don't start in the planning phase and then move back to the discovery phase later. That's how they get in real trouble. That's how mistakes are made. If you want to be perceived as an advisor, you need to start where advisors start, and that is some type of assessment, some type of review, or some type of discovery. Otherwise, you're skipping the most vital step of an advisory process. If a doctor skipped that, they would end up in prison. If an attorney skipped the discovery phase of what they do, they would never win a case. What we're proposing is that you start with discovery and work your way out from there. Discovery is the holy grail in sales.

We mentioned earlier in the book that differentiation is only found by comparing one thing to the next. And so most people reading this book really want to be different. If you were to show a prospect the graph we just showed you of what an advisory process looks like, it's the beginning of them seeing that you are different. They can compare that to most brokers that are offering a quote/bid as a way to differentiate. The real start for an advisor to differentiate is to show them an advisory process and what they can get from this different approach compared to what they receive with the typical industry-driven quote/bid.
