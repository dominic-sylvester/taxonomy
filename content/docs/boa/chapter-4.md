title: Chapter Four
description: The Holy Grail In Sales (Discovery)
---

We know it may sound like a stretch when we say the title of this chapter is "The Holy Grail in Sales," but let us share with you, in 20 years of riding in the car side-by-side with producers in this industry, whether it's employee benefits or property and casualty, we win business in the discovery phase of the Blueprint process. And again, when we talk about the Holy Grail in sales, what we're talking about is the ability of a salesperson to get real buyers open and honest with you, the advisor, about their current situation and what they would like to see happen and what problems or hassles they would like to see go away.

If we can capture all that, we can create a real proposal that's meaningful, which is what makes it the holy grail of sales. We can create a better plan. We can take their program apart and put it back together the right way. And that's ultimately what a powerful discovery session is all about.

In this chapter, we want to share with you how to facilitate a very meaningful discovery session so that you can better understand what your prospects are dealing with so that you can take all of this investment that you've made in your toolboxes and your staff and all the years of wisdom that you collected so that you can put it to good use. If you are new and don't feel like you have much wisdom yet, because you don't, that's ok. Remember you are one member of a bigger team, and your job is to bring the resources together and to keep deals moving to the point of close.

### The Open — Starting a Discovery Meeting

When we talk about the best ways to facilitate a powerful discovery session, it all begins with the right mindset. And that mindset is that this is all about THEM. The more we can disconnect ourselves from the outcome for ourselves, the better it will go. The more we can disconnect from whether we're going to get hired at the end of this, the better our discovery meeting will be. Any sales process you run will always be better if you can make the focus about them instead of the focus being about you and all your "stuff." Remember, we lead to our tools, not with our tools. Discovery is an opportunity for you to learn very important details about them. It is not an opportunity for them to learn things about you (yet!). We're not going to solve problems in the discovery phase of the process. We mustn't do that for several reasons. One reason is, if they say to you, "No one's ever talked to me about that, how would you solve that problem?" The standard answer should be, "I don't know yet. I will know by the time we're done, but I may find something out in the next few minutes that causes me to change my mind."

We want to save the solutions for 3rd base of the proposal (blueprint). One reason is so that we don't commoditize ourselves, but we also want to be able to stack everything we learn up against their incumbent and other competitors we might be competing with on a deal. We're going to learn many things about how your prospect is being served by their incumbent broker through this process, even though we aren't discussing them directly. And when we bring back the proposal, we want to stack all of that against them. The prospect should be able to see, in black and white, how badly they are being underserved. All the things you learn are your big wins coming out of the discovery meeting. And the more we can get in the right frame of mind about what is in it for them—
-that this is about them and we're going to challenge their way of thinking-the better. We're going to dig in for them to win no matter what, which will produce a better proposal from us and raise our closing ratios. When we look at the history of our company in the past more than 18 years, even when we were just getting started and didn't have a lot of the tools that we have now, our closing ratios, when someone took a prospect through the discovery phase, were very, very high.

Remember second base (discovery) on the baseball diamond?—it's scoring position, and it is in the Blueprint Process as well.

Our closing ratios have been 70% to 80% from the beginning, and it has to do mostly with, first of all, getting in the right frame of mind.
It's about them. It's not about us. Taking yourself out of the middle of your thinking and replacing it with your ideal client/prospect is powerful.
Everything we have added to the process over the years hasn't impacted closing ratios significantly, but it has had a big impact on the adoption rate at the producer level. We have a paint-by-numbers now. Back then, it was more of a blank canvas, and most people just don't feel comfortable in that environment.

When we rode with producers every day for years, and when we were facilitating a discovery meeting while still in the car on the way to the appointment, we would always remind everyone that this meeting is about them, not about us. In fact, we would always play a little game before we went into a discovery meeting, and the premise was this: This prospect cannot make us their broker; however, they have paid us $100,000 to take their program apart and put it back together the right way, but we can't become their broker. There's a political reason why we can't become their broker. In fact, the statue out in front of the prospect's building was the incumbent broker who was in a bunker in Vietnam with the owner of the business and pulled him out to safety and got shot in the butt like Forrest Gump on the way back to safety. That's who the incumbent is. But the incumbent is no good. They know he's no good. They just can't get rid of them. However, they're willing to pay us to take their program apart and put it back together the right way. And they paid us $ 100,000 to do it right. So we're going to go in here, and we are going to make a difference. That's our role today. We're going to uncover everything we can about how they're currently doing things so that we can help them moving forward, and they're going to pay us $ 100,000 for it.

That's the scenario. It is effective at helping us get into the right mindset. It's about them, not about us.

We want to make sure also that you understand that just because we're going to put their interests first does not mean that we give them anything and everything that they ask for or that we will capitulate to going through the process they want us to use (bid/quote or RFP). That's bad for them and also bad for us. Just because our intentions are really good for them to win doesn't mean we're going to do anything they ask of us. Remember that. We want to make sure everyone understands that as you read this.

So beyond getting in the right mindset for a powerful discovery meeting, we must also start the meeting off the right way. We need to set the stage for how this meeting is going to flow and what we are going to do with the information we glean in our discussions. To do that, let them know where we are in the overall process. Show them the process map and point to the discovery stage so they will be able to see what has happened and what is coming up later.

_Mr. and Mrs. Buyer, we are here, and our goal today is to better understand your situation to ultimately take your program apart so we can put it back together in a way that it will perform better. After today the next step in the process (point to the next step) is to bring you back our findings (proposal or Blueprint). We're not going to be recommending solutions today. That will be our next meeting, and we will schedule that before we leave here. Mr. and Mrs. Buyer, our ultimate goal is to help you understand what you could be doing differently, perform better, and compare what that looks like. Also, we want to help you identify financial levers you could be pulling to get a better financial deal and have confidence that you're getting the best one possible. Also, we're going to help you understand how you can take every dollar you are spending and get a much better return on that — multiply the effectiveness of each dollar, if you will._

_Lastly, before we come back for our next meeting, we're going to get everyone aligned around a plan to implement. We call it a Blueprint (Roadmap, Navigation Plan, Playbook, etc.)._

_That is what we're trying to do today, to gather the right information to build you a better plan. I also want you to know, Mr. And Mrs. Buyer, that we are going to ask you things that a traditional "broker" would not ask you. So be prepared for questions that are outside of the normal spectrum. We know you may be thinking, why is he asking me that? Because it's not a typical question, but we're trying to broaden the scope a little here, broaden the viewfinder so that we can understand more about your situation that could impact the plan we put together._

_And just so you know, let us explain why we will ask the prospect different things that they're not used to being asked._

Many times, when we would ride with producers, we would ask questions that weren't as direct as the questions they were used to from a broker. We could tell people were wondering, why are they asking me that? What does that have to do with my insurance? And so it would occupy their mind, and we didn't want that to happen. So as a standard part of opening up a discovery session that we will facilitate, we will let them know different types of questions will be coming. It will make sense when we bring back your proposal. By letting them know in advance that we will be asking different types of questions, it will allow them to focus on answering the question instead of wondering why we are asking it.

Let's transition out of the set-up phase of a discovery meeting and into facilitating an in-depth discussion about their situation and getting them talking.

## (Employee Benefits written by Chad)

### The Middle of the Discovery Meeting

We start diving into their world by opening up with some vision casting. I'll tell you, it is a common piece missing in most sales processes.
Salespeople are so focused on finding pain or highlighting a tool they believe in that they miss this step. It is our favorite thing to discuss, and it is exciting for your prospects to look into the future. Also, remember, as we looked at earlier when discussing the Change Formula, vision is a key piece to getting people to overcome their resistance to change.

To get them to start vision casting with us, it can sound something like this:

_I would like each of you to answer this question. If we were looking down the road two years from now, and you were really excited about some of the outcomes that your benefits and workforce initiatives were getting, if all things were possible, what would some of those things be? What would be happening then that's not happening now? (that could easily be replaced with Insurance and risk management initiatives)._

One time we were facilitating a discovery meeting. This was about a $150,000 revenue account, and there were five people on their side of the table, and the person with the least seniority told us that she didn't know what she could add to the conversation. We said, "Anything that you have to add to where you would like to see this thing going if all things were possible is valuable to us."

_And she said, "Well, I spend 80% of my time answering benefits questions from the employees, so if there's a way to get some of that back, that could be good."_

And we said, "Okay, great. That is a great thing to understand." And then we looked at the other executives, including the highest-ranking person, the CFO, and asked if we could get that time back that she's committed to answering benefits questions. "Is there anybody in the room that would have better things for her to do with that time?" And everyone started speaking up about different things she could help them with. It made a huge difference in us getting the deal, and the lower-level employee really loved that people were fighting over her.

It's important that everyone in the room answers the vision question. Remember, this is your process. You're the ones making a real investment into them, and it will only work for them and for you if they participate at a high level. Even to the point where if we find people are going through the motions, we can close our notebook and say, "We can't help you if you all won't talk to us. If you would like to stop or postpone the process, we can." That type of thinking might seem risky to you, but it's appropriate considering all that is at stake. Again, if they aren't going to talk to you, they aren't going to hire you.

When they do start talking and telling you something about their vision casting, make sure that you get excited with them. Show some emotional intelligence. They may tell you something that they've been thinking about for a long time that they really want to get done. They just haven't figured out how to do it yet. Get excited with them, regardless of what they tell you. They may tell you they want to implement some better communication tools. Who knows?

When they see you as more of an advisor to employers instead of just a quote/bid, unquote/unbid broker, they will tell you things they wouldn't tell a traditional broker. They're going to say things to you that you might not have an item in your toolbox to fix. That's okay. Get excited with them anyway. That happens quite a bit. It's a good sign when someone tells you what they would really like to see happen, and it's not quote/ bid, unquote/unbid, broker related.

As an example, this is something that we hear quite a bit, surprisingly, "We would like to offer more training to our front-line managers. We realize that is a real weakness that's holding us back."
Things like that can happen. Don't shy away from it, even though you don't have employee training as a resource. At the very least, when we bring back their proposal, we can tell them that we'll put together an RFP to help them find some front-line manager training. I even have a client that started a management training division because it was such a problem in their market.

Another interesting fact about discovery is that you hear recurring themes that can inform you of where you need to be making investments in your tools and resources to help your clients so that you can capture the flag in ways that you might not have thought of before.

In vision casting, you want to document everything. If we can put their vision list on their whiteboard or carry a big flip chart in with us and write these vision components down and hang them on the wall with blue painter's tape, then let's do it. Anything we can do to make what they tell us visible and get excited, they will attach us to their vision.

Now let's transition from vision casting to a different component of The Change Formula, the dissatisfaction part. A great way to get people talking about what they're frustrated about is to tell them, "We know when we're talking about employees and rising costs of all of this that there can be frustrations. Nothing is perfect. So let's talk about that. What are the things you find most frustrating about administering your employee health care, employee benefits, and workforce initiatives? What would you say is the most frustrating thing?"

Again, nothing is perfect, but it's a great way to attack that. It's going to be what they're most dissatisfied with. They'll tell you those things, and often in a discovery session, people might be more ready to open up about things they're frustrated with, about their incumbent broker, that they weren't willing to do in the initial meeting or earlier in the process. In fact, it happens all the time.

Don't be shocked when they open up. When they realize cool things that can be happening that aren't, they can start to get more frustrated with their incumbent than they've led you to believe. It happens all the time. Another way to unpack whether somebody's dissatisfied, instead of hitting it head-on and asking them what they're frustrated with, we can ask them, "What are some of the roadblocks that could keep your vision from happening?"

It's just another way to question the prospects about where they might be frustrated or dissatisfied. We're just using a different language to do it. I'm a very optimistic person, so I don't know if I have the language to express that I'm experiencing problems. Problems are not really in my psyche. Frustrations are in my psyche. Roadblocks that are impeding my progress are in my psyche. I don't identify with the word "problems."

Your buyers might be the same way. What's most important is don't worry so much about my exact words but that we have to get people to articulate where they're dissatisfied. We have to get them to articulate their vision for the future. Those are two primary components of The Change Formula that are necessary for people to overcome their resistance to change.

Once we've done a powerful vision casting and identified the roadblocks that could keep them from achieving their vision, we're going to start into the questioning phase that's more specific by toolbox. Whether it's cost containment strategies, benefits administration, HR advocacy strategies, compliance, etc., things that are important but that many people don't do very well in discovery. Our ultimate goal is to figure out how they're currently doing things so that we can bring back a better way for them to do each of those things.

One thing we have created to help you efficiently and in a very structured way understand somebody's situation is the scorecard. You can see in Graphic 4.1(below) a sample scorecard. We create many different types of scorecards with our clients depending on vertical, discipline, or other variables. This is a generic version showing that we're making a drastic comparison. You can see on the left side that their situation is very reactive.

<div align="center">Table 4.1 Sample Scorecard</div>

On the right side, the ten side, they're proactive about the things they're doing. That is a simple example. They can be long or short, and these are samples of the type of information we can gather. We want them to weigh in on a scale of one to ten. My situation is very reactive. In fact, on the employee healthcare side, their whole process starts when they get a much higher renewal than they expected, and then all these wheels go into motion to get that problem solved. It's very reactive. It's another simple way to get a buyer to weigh in.

Another question that you could put on the scorecard is on the left side, which is the low-performing side, that my program is not very transparent. On the high-performing side, my program is very transparent. It speaks to the idea that they know or don't know why they are paying what they are paying. Those are two simple but different examples of scorecard questions, and we want these people to give their answers independently of each other.

In a perfect world, we would send out the scorecard in advance of the discovery meeting for everyone to fill out independently and return to us. And you can see in Graphic 4.2 (below) how we've taken three different executives' answers to these questions, and we've charted them on this graph so that we can see how everyone has answered to help them create the alignment that is often missing on these things. There's always a lack of alignment, and it does hold these people back, and we're going to help them get that alignment. That's what a scorecard can do.

|                                                                                                                            |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |                                                                                                                                                               |

<div align="center">Table 4.2</div>

And again, the premise behind the scorecard is, please tell me why you gave me that score. We talk about that and about what they think needs to happen for their score to go up. It's a powerful part of the process to get information quickly.

I recently went through a throat cancer treatment protocol, and every week when I met with my oncologist, I had to fill out a scorecard on a scale of one to ten, expressing how much suffering I was dealing with based on many different variables. It was a fast way to find outliers and put a treatment in place. There are so many things each day that pop up in cancer treatment of this type, and faster, more accurate information is very helpful for the patient.

Whether it was a lack of saliva, mouth pain, anxiety, sleeplessness, or breathing-all these different possible side effects of chemo and radiation each week. That was how they quickly gained an understanding of how my treatment was going. We're using that same efficiency system to find out how somebody feels about a certain area of their business.

Other examples could be someone you know going to a new restaurant, movie, etc. I often ask, "On a scale of one to ten, what did you think about it?" I can understand quickly how they felt about that restaurant or movie or whatever it may be. That's what our scorecard is intended to do—provide some structure and efficiency to a powerful discovery session.

So now we have set the stage for the discovery meeting. We have gone through the vision casting and identified where they're dissatisfied, what their roadblocks are, and what they're frustrated with. We have discussed the scorecard on different aspects of their benefits program and workforce that we need to understand that they need to be aligned around.

I can also go beyond the scorecard and ask them questions to get more depth. Here are a few examples of those, and then we'll give a few examples: "Walk me through how you..." "Tell me in as much detail about how you handle..."

These aren't questions at all; they are statements that are more effective than open-ended questions. They force the person to open up to you in a unique way, and—more importantly-they can't tell you about a process they don't have, which eventually exposes the incumbent.

I also like to ask if there are elements of their program that they like and would like to keep. I would never give a proposal without knowing the answer to that question.

Let me explain what I want you to understand about a discovery meeting. Some of you intuitively know what I'm trying to do here. I'm trying to take their program apart and put it back together. If you write a lot of business by looking at, and reading stop-loss contracts, then by all means, get the stop-loss contracts. Leaving the discovery meeting, nothing is off-limits. Whatever you need to know, the discovery meeting is the time to ask. Because their guard is down. This is the time to ask. Remember, discovery is where we take their program apart, and when we leave the discovery meeting, building their plan is the way we start to put it back together the right way.

### The final part of the discovery meeting and setting the next meeting - The Blueprint.

As we wrap up the discovery meeting and we have learned everything we needed to know, we've asked for any documents we need. It could be their enrollment guide, stop-loss contract, HR handbook, etc. There are many things that can give us insight into how they're currently doing things so that we can show how we would improve upon them. What we want to do before we leave is schedule the Blueprint meeting or the proposal meeting before we get out of there. Let them know that the hard work on their part is now finished. Now the hard work for us is beginning. We will spend hours reviewing this information and putting your plan together. It's going to take us some time to do that.

The ideal timeframe to schedule your meeting for the proposal is two weeks. It will be hard to get everybody scheduled exactly two weeks from that day, but I want to give you that time frame as a benchmark because if we bring it back too quickly, we lose some of this power. We lose the mental imagery of us burning the midnight oil, sitting in the conference room with empty pizza boxes, and lying on the floor as we are all exhausted.

At first, when you create a proposal in the way we recommend, it will take some time, but it won't take as long after a few rotations. It'll be much easier by your third or fourth time. There are a lot of items in previous proposals that will stay in future proposals. Even though this is customized, there are very few pieces that we will end up having to customize later —because even the problems that employers are experiencing are the same, not just our solutions. Understand that it will get much quicker to build these. But even when we can do them quickly, we can still create the impression that more work went into it than we actually did.

Just as returning too quickly with a blueprint causes a potentially negative effect, waiting longer than two weeks can also cause a negative effect. When we do that a lot of the emotional information they gave us will begin to dissipate. Two weeks is the perfect time frame to try and reschedule around. You want everybody in the discovery meeting to be in the blueprint meeting. And you need to set up that you're not going to deliver the blueprint if somebody backs out last minute. It's very important that you say whoever is in the meeting now needs to be in the next meeting so that we can maintain our congruency and we're all on the same page. The team we start with is the team we need to finish with. I would ask, "Are we all on the same page with that?" And they nod their heads. Then we coordinate calendars for everybody.

What that sets up for you is that if somebody tries to step out of the conversation later, you can reschedule the meeting because the worst is when the only person that can tell you yes decides to step out at the last minute. This provides a defense for us to be able to reschedule the meeting.

## (P&C Discovery Meeting written by Jeff)

So you've got a prospect that has already shown you they're different from a lot of others in that they didn't expect you to just take a stack of documents and go to market. They've agreed to carve out an hour with their leadership team to spend with you. What is your sole objective here? To serve them. To help them. If you weren't worried about getting hired, just quit worrying about getting hired. Just serve people. We found that it serves you well. Again, they've already shown you they differ from the average prospect. If we're going to serve them, don't forget we may have some people in this meeting that weren't in your initial meeting. So just remind them, "Hey, we're not here to quote/bid your insurance. We are here to see if we can help you reduce risk and improve the ROI of your insurance program. I want you all to think about this for a second." Set the stage that we're in a business where most people are focused on going to market, which is about one component of managing risk, and that is the transfer piece.

If you want to look at the planet's simplest risk management model, there are three steps to it, and transferring risk is the last step. So first, we look to identify risk, then we look to mitigate that risk, and then we transfer risk. This meeting will follow that format. To provide some structure to the meeting and also get a ton of information in a short amount of time, we will use a scorecard to help. It will also create some alignment on their side that is difficult to get as they all score themselves differently.

One of the most powerful parts about using the scorecard with multiple buyers in the room is they didn't know that others felt the way they did about some of their issues. We get to be the beneficiaries of that. Discovery is about discovering what you want from your prospect to help them. As EOS implementers, we believe in scorecards of all types inside the agency. They work beautifully for prospects too. If you are too insecure to send it out in advance, we get that too; bring them with you to the meeting, pass them out, and start discussing. You don't have to use a scorecard if you don't want to. It's there to prompt the conversations that will help you identify, mitigate and transfer risk in a meaningful way.

If you think about it, we help people in three ways. You help people through dialogue. If you go to the doctor, the doctor asks what's wrong.

They help you through dialogue. The doctor can get your records or documents, but the doctor can also look at you. It's no different here. If we build a blueprint proposal, it will be through dialogue, documents, and what we can inspect with our eyes. So the more they let us uncover and the more they talk to us, the better their blueprint is going to be.

Let's set the stage and let them know what we're trying to do. You can tell them we have some big, sophisticated clients with full-time risk managers, but only 2% or 3% of companies have full-time risk managers. What we're here to do is to compare your program to theirs. We've got a series of toolboxes, and we know risk managers have these tools. We're going to walk through some of these toolboxes and see if you are utilizing all the tools at your disposal for the money you are already paying. Do you know about them? Should you be using them? Etc.

Our ultimate goal is to reduce costs by reducing risk. We're going to be able to help you drive greater ROI for this, and it's going to be no burden on you.

As you start the discovery meeting—and this is really fun—we're going to ask a question early that will tell you a lot really quickly and then probe from there with other questions that give us valuable intel about their disposition toward risk and insurance. This is before we ever get to the scorecard. Do they see insurance as transactional or strategic? What's the biggest thing that you worry about happening to this company that could really impair your results? These days we might even have people say a pandemic. We wouldn't have heard that three years ago. But the reason we ask that question is that we want to see if they discuss risk or premiums. If they see this as a transaction, then we've got a little work to do to help them understand that premiums go down when risk is reduced.

We're trying to figure out how the prospect views insurance. We do that by asking a vision question. "If we're sitting here three years from now and celebrating your progress with your risk management and insurance program, what would be happening then? I mean, if it's perfect, what would that look like? What would have to change?" Follow that up with what roadblocks could keep that from happening or something similar.

They will tell you the premium would be lower, or they will talk about safety culture and employees following safety guidelines, etc. You're going to know quickly what you're dealing with.

Early on, we just ask those simple questions: What do you worry about? What would it look like to have the perfect insurance risk management program? What roadblocks could hold you back? I promise you will know if they see this as a quote/bid or if they're seeing this as a little more strategic.

Once we have that discussion, we can move to the scorecard. A scorecard is there to prompt dialogue and, most importantly, to prompt the right dialogue. And instead of starting out saying like old-school insurance people, "Can we review your policies?" We go at it from a very different angle. We are trying to make a difference.

We ask them about their risk appetite. One of the scorecard questions we ask as a standard protocol is what their risk appetite looks like on a scale of one to ten. As a follow-up question, we ask them how confident they are that their program aligns with their risk appetite.

What if the business owner and the CFO have different answers? The business owner is aggressive, but the CFO is more conservative. It's always a great conversation; a common response is that they haven't had a conversation like this before.

Maybe the business owner is a nine, and the CFO is a three on the scorecard. We had a producer we work with win a large transportation account, $300,000 in revenue, a couple of years ago because all he had was a high deductible option on auto liability for a transportation firm. The CFO was very conservative, and he felt like, If I could get to the business owner, I could write this account because his appetite for risk fits this.

He finally got the business owner engaged. And he was right. He had a greater appetite for risk and loved our producer's program, and we wrote it. Our first goal is to get the business owner and CFO together on their risk appetite so they can build the right plan.

Remember risk management. You identify risk, you mitigate risk, and then you transfer. The most important thing you'll ever do is help somebody identify risk and identify how much of that they want to retain and how much they want to transfer.

Think about this. Until I understand your risk appetite, I don't know how to talk to you about some lines of coverage that some people carry and others don't. Like cyber liability, employment practices, or D&O for a privately held firm.

Once you know their risk appetite, you will talk to them through the lens of that risk appetite. Say, I'm trying to get you to consider some optional coverage that not everybody buys. Once we get that, look for your blueprint. We tell people, "We're going to need a copy of your policies. And all we want to do is report any area where your program is out of alignment with your risk appetite." It will probably be one of those meaningful things you get out of discovery.

Now we're going to talk about losses in the blueprint world. In the typical broker process, people sling losses as fast as they can to get to the market that they think will be competitive, to block everybody else, as we discussed in the initial meeting with market mayhem. But we've got to stop and say, what's an underwriter trying to achieve? I've reviewed so many annual reports, so I know that for most of these insurance companies, before we got to this difficult market, they're just not interested if a risk has a greater than s 50% loss ratio.

We need to slow down. We need to get five years of loss information, and we need to look through that first and understand what the loss ratio is. How's the market going to look at this account? We refer to this process as loss modeling. We ask them head-on to walk us through their loss modeling process, what it reveals, and what changes they typically make when they go through the process.

Most of the time, we get very low answers-twos and threes on our scorecard regarding loss modeling. It's a soft spot in their armor. It's a soft spot for the prospect and their incumbent broker. When we do it this way, we are assuming the role of an educator, an advisor. We are also chipping away at their current beliefs. Everybody cares about premiums, but nobody understands that this is the number one area that's going to determine what they pay. An underwriter looks at how much risk they see in terms of what losses they're going to have. Then they add some expenses and some profit, and that's how the premium the prospect pays is calculated.

When everybody's slinging these loss runs quickly to block the markets without stopping, that would be like swinging a 580 credit report out to several mortgage lenders instead of going, "Wait a second, is there anything we can do to increase this credit score?" Because we're never going to get "A" paper. Losses and credit scores are the same things. A credit score is probably the most important determinant of getting a paper on any loan.

If we can get five years of loss information, think of the things we can do. If you do a five-year premium and loss summary, that is their current situation. In the five-year premium loss summary by line of business, you look at General Liability; what did they pay in the last two years?

What were their losses? We lay out every year, and then aggregate that over five years for all lines of business.

Does this account need to be marketed? Does it need to be broken up? Market one line of business separately from the others. Most import-antly, loss modeling is a verb. It is active.

We look at these losses to determine if we make this loss ratio look better. How can we do that? Well, number one, we can lower a reserve. Number two, we can explain a shock loss and all the risk mitigation, all the controls that have been put in place to make sure that never happens again. Number three, if there are a lot of claims under work comp for lost time, and you're a specialist at "return to work," we can make some assumptions in the loss model about how much we can cut those if we're looking at a lot of commercial auto claims.

Recently we had a producer working on a deal, and most markets would not quote/bid this commercial auto risk. However, one underwriter did her own loss modeling exercise, and she asked, "Is there any way he would be willing to change the driver profile?"

And the prospect, out of desperation, said, "Yes, what do you want me to do?" And she said, "I want you to hire older, more experienced drivers."

Now, I don't know how he did that during "the great resignation," but I know he did, and here's why. I know he called his broker back six months later, and he said, "I want you to remarket my account midterm."

The broker was confused and said, "Why would you want to do that?" And he responded, "Because all my losses have gone away."

This underwriter understood from looking at the losses that they could drive the losses down on this account if he changed the actual drivers. She's using just good practical risk mitigation techniques.

Some other examples of simple, common sense loss modeling methods could be: having one insurance company look at three years of losses instead of five, and the three-year loss pick is much better—that's loss modeling. If you get ten years' loss information, it's a hell of a lot better than the five-year pick, and one underwriter looks at it — that's loss modeling: anything and everything you can do. And as an industry, we miss the boat on this.

After you educate about loss modeling, you will ask for the five-year losses. If we can help them figure out their risk appetite and align their policies, that allows you to see if they have wrong coverages. Not only are you helping them fix their program, but you're bloodying up their incumbent, making it difficult for them to have the confidence they had before you came in with this process with their incumbent. Once we get the policies right (risk tolerance) and go into loss modeling, we can now think of these as two of our toolboxes.

We went through our risk tolerance toolbox to get the policies right. Now we're going to move to our loss modeling toolbox. After that, we moved to perhaps the most important toolbox, risk mitigation. Anything and everything that you can think of that would help mitigate risk.

Underwriters want you to shrink risk. The less risk they see, the less premium. Shrinking risk could be helping your client navigate a pandemic, keep a driver on a truck, etc.

Effective risk mitigation impacts their productivity and their profitability. Mitigating risk is good for a company without having anything to do with insurance. When you start a company, you have risk, period. And the more somebody can help you shrink that risk, the better off they will be. Think of it this way: they've got all this top-line revenue they work really hard to create, and all the risk in their company is sucking the revenue out the back door.

It's revenue being lost to pay for risk. The more we can help people shrink risk, the more we can lower their costs and drive a greater ROI.

This business is separating. As an industry, we have a decision to make. Are we going to be brokers that sell insurance in a Red Ocean or advisors that help people shrink risk in a Blue Ocean?

We also now have another toolbox, the risk mitigation toolbox. What are the kind of tools and capabilities that might be in your risk mitigation toolbox?

Let's look at commercial auto: It would be questions about hiring drivers.

What does that look like? What are your requirements for hiring a driver? Are they using telematics? Do they have fleet maintenance? We know how to mitigate risk in a discovery meeting. Please give me the top five initiatives you currently have to prevent commercial auto losses. You can ask the same of work comp. What are the top five initiatives you have to keep your people safe on the job?

This is so fun when you get the hang of it. We are really helping people by simply asking them questions that lead to solutions they didn't know existed. Do you have five more? Do you have five that are a lot better? You know what else is cool? If they know more than you, you didn't lose.

If they're better than you, you now have a better top five or a better top ten than you had before to use with every other prospect and client.

We have built a Discovery Workbook with a database of possible questions by toolbox, depending on the type of risk. We think it's one of the reasons we get new producers up and running so quickly.

Can you see a Blueprint-type proposal coming together in your mind? We hope so.

Since we can mitigate risk both before and after a loss, we can't forget to dive into Post Loss Risk Mitigation. We have already discussed what someone is doing to prevent the loss, so let's take those same two lines of business, auto, and comp, and look at Post Loss Risk Mitigation. Your competitors often overlook this.

Let's start with Work Comp. An employee has just been hurt on the job. Let's get the prospect to walk us through from the second they got hurt until they returned to work to see if they have already been educated on Post Loss Risk Mitigation or if this is an area we can help them improve.

We are listening for two key items in their program at this point:

1. Do they have a nurse hotline? As many as four out of ten claims have been eliminated for many companies by allowing a nurse to direct care.
   Everything from "Call 911" to "Put a Band-Aid on the finger and let them get back to work." So that's the first thing we're listening for, and many companies don't have that yet.
2. Next, we are listening to see if they have a sound return to work or light duty policy. We know that in many jurisdictions, we can get up to a
   70% discount off the claim amounts if we can restrict the claim to medical only with no lost time.

Same with Commercial Auto: This question simply asks them to walk you through their procedure when they have an accident. If one of your drivers in a pickup gets in a wreck, walk us through your procedure from the second they step out of the cab of that truck all the way to when the claim gets paid.

Much like Work Comp, you know the procedures your best clients follow to lessen any resulting claim payout. Here are a few easy ones:

1. Don't admit fault
2. Take pics
3. Should they call anyone at your office?
4. Claim advocacy on larger claims

And a reminder, we don't offer solutions during discovery. It'd be just like giving away the end of the movie in the middle. You don't want to do that. You'll screw up your blueprint meeting. They might even ask you, what do you think about our auto procedures after a loss? Please tell them that you don't know yet. Tell them that you are still getting a kind of 360-degree view. Even let them know that you have some people at the office that are specialists at this stuff, so I'm not really prepared to comment on that yet. Let them know that it will be in their blueprint.

Think how different that is from the typical salesperson. When somebody is trying to get them to comment, they want to show how much they know and how brilliant they are. You will never do that again. Make them excited to see the end of the movie... your blueprint.

Now, back to the idea of pre- or post-loss risk mitigation. Anything you can think of that could prevent a loss or hold down the amount of the loss should be discussed now. This is where you'd ask to review employee handbooks if you like to do that. One of the things I like about an advisory sales process like Blueprint is that when you're asking for documents, there's much better context. You ask for policies because you want to see if their program aligns with their unique risk appetite. You asked for losses because you want to do loss modeling to see if you can present a better picture or story to the underwriter.

You ask for their policy relating to sexual harassment, termination, or anything that might create exposure for these people. Maybe it's minutes from a safety meeting or a safety handbook; it can be anything. You might even ask them if there is anything they want you to review relating to safety or any concern. There may be a sell agreement between two partners. Is it structured and funded adequately?

We are not looking to tell you everything you should want to know from reading this book. You should want to know what you want to know based on your firm's tools.

We do want to get you thinking about the toolboxes: risk tolerance, loss modeling, and risk mitigation. When you're out on a job site and observe a lockout tag in a manufacturing facility, you recognize that it would go in the risk mitigation toolbox. The more you can start to place all your tools in the toolboxes, the easier it is to execute the model.

Someone tells you about a really good "return to work" program, and you comment on how effective that is in the Risk Mitigation Toolbox (post-loss). You can then let the prospect know that you have invested in many more tools. Prospects love to know that you've done this before, that it has a structure to it, that you've thought it through, and that the toolboxes and where each of your tools fit make this so much easier for a prospect to gain both trust and understanding in your process.

The last toolbox I'll talk about is the non-insurance transfer. That's just the signing of these hold harmless/indemnity agreements, the requisite insurance requirements, and the certificate tracking that closes the loop.

Underwriters have to know that you've got this handled correctly, or it will result in much larger premiums or in some underwriters simply denying to offer any terms or pricing.

A good example is an agency client of mine that had a prospect who was going to supply lifeguards to one of the top hotels in Las Vegas—a hotel that anyone reading this book would know. They kept getting declinations from underwriters, even those that write insurance for water parks, and it just did not make sense. They finally learned what the issue was, and it was the same for everyone.

The contract between the hotel and the companies furnishing the lifeguards was too vague. The underwriters didn't know what their real exposure was—underwriters like certainty. It's easiest just to pass on the risk altogether, even if it's an exposure you insure daily.

Another example was a general contractor in Missouri who traveled to Texas to complete a project. This created a need for them to buy work comp in Texas. They purchased a policy from the largest writer of WC in the state. At the end of the policy term, they were hit with a $150,000 premium audit. Everyone involved was livid and wanted an explanation, and the carrier let them know that the contract they had in place with their subcontractors did not adequately transfer the comp exposure. The insurance company felt that they had significant exposure for injuries to the sub's employees and wanted to be compensated for that.

In another instance, both a general and a sub were required to carry $25 million limits. Both had the required limits, and the general had evidence of insurance via a Certificate of Insurance. The problem was that they did not have a contract in place.

Why is that so important? Consider the story of the Hard Rock Cafe in New Orleans that collapsed during construction. It's a very sad story due to the loss of life, but also instructive regarding the importance of having contracts in place.

Following the collapse of the structure, pre-completion, three workers were buried under the rubble, one for more than ten months. Can you imagine the finger-pointing and mess following this loss? Who was at fault? Everybody will get named in that litigation, and if your limits are being eroded due to someone else's negligence, what a mess. Let's say the developer or general contractor was not at fault in any way, but how does anyone determine that absent a good contract in place? Obviously, we are not attorneys at Blueprint, but I think it's easy to see what an unmitigated disaster this could be. Bottom line: if not handled correctly, these contracts can create audit premiums or, much worse, impair the limits needed when the really big claim happens.

Using the scorecard approach, we can ask a prospect to score their renewal experience. On one end, they hate the process, and on the other, they love it. This is really telling you what they think of their agent.

It's funny how these scores have a tendency to come back a 1 or a 10. The score is unimportant, but the reason behind it is what we want to discuss. This helps you to really understand if there is an opportunity or if you should walk away. A word of caution, don't forget they scored this before your discovery meeting. You have just had some really good dialogue about all these toolboxes you use to get folks to a better place. It may be fun to ask them to rescore that if they had scored a 10 previously.

And so now, step back and think about the overall approach. Risk managers work to shrink risk all year, not just during the last 60 to 90 days. An advisor is much more than a broker who works the last 60-90 days to collect a check.

Discovery is about really seeking to understand if we can help each prospect. We are putting our servant hat on and digging to see what is really going on, especially as it relates to:

1.  Risk Tolerance and whether the program is structured properly
2.  Loss Modeling
3.  Risk Mitigation both Pre- and Post-Loss
4.  Contractual Risk Transfer

The more we get comfortable with our tools and perhaps those we need to acquire, the easier discovery becomes. A real advisor knows where to look to help someone. Keep using the toolboxes; they have a highly structured approach to getting your prospects and clients a much better return on investment with every dollar they spend on insurance.
